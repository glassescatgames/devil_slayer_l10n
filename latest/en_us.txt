book.book_baike_001.title=Shop in the Wilderness
book.book_baike_001.desc=Only the mysterious merchant Baldwyn is willing to do business amidst the chaos of the wastes and the battlefield. The goods in the shop aren't bad, but you can't trust the prices, they just keep going up. That is unless you've got connections, otherwise, I would advise you to spend your coin with care there. For every chapter cleared, the store prices are reset, you should take advantage of this. Now, you won't necessarily come across Baldwyn's store everywhere you go. Baldwyn may not be the sanest of people, but even he doesn't set up shop in the underworld.
book.book_baike_002.title=Baldwyn's Bank
book.book_baike_002.desc=The mysterious merchant Baldwyn has set up a private bank on the side. If you happen to come across him, you can deposit gold coins with him and pick them up whenever it is convenient for you, including on later travels. Having said that, getting your coins back from him can be a bit tricky as you have to defeat him in a battle to do so and each time you do, you can only withdraw a maximum of 100 coins.
book.book_baike_003.title=Challenge Zones
book.book_baike_003.desc=If you happen to see a lamp post in the wilderness emitting blue souls, then you know you're in a challenge zone. Legend has it that the challenge zones were set up by the Samsara Society. If you trigger a soul lamppost, formidable foes will be teleported to the area. If the challenger can escape victorious, the rewards will be great and may even include lost scrolls. Some say that the Samsara Society use these challenges as a way of selecting their members.
book.book_baike_004.title=Hidden Areas
book.book_baike_004.desc=Each level has a hidden area. Normally, there is no way to see the entrance and it can only be opened by using a disenchantment bead in front of the phantom. As hidden areas only have one entrance and they are connected to normal areas, they are not that hard to find. Disenchantment beads aren't exactly rare as well. The experts in food charms from the offal temple can make them for you.
book.book_baike_005.title=Treasure Rooms
book.book_baike_005.desc=From time to time useful things can be found out in the wilderness. For whatever reasons they may have, some people have taken to locking items of value away in treasure rooms out in the wilderness. If a traveler just happens to have a key on them, they can abscond with whatever treasure they may find with relative ease. Having said that, some say that they have come across monsters hiding in treasure rooms lying in wait for unsuspecting travelers. Too many are those that have fallen prey to their own greedy hearts in these very treasure rooms.
book.book_baike_006.title=Locked Treasure Chest
book.book_baike_006.desc=Locked Treasure Chests can be found out in the wilderness. If you happen to have an extra key handy, why not open the chest up and take a look? While it's not often that rare booty can be found, but what you find inside is significantly more valuable than the key that you use to open it. If you want to make sure you have enough gold coins to go shopping at the store, opening treasure chests is a must. It's even been passed down that lost scrolls can be found in these locked treasure chests.
book.book_baike_007.title=Deserted City
book.book_baike_007.desc=Natural disasters in the northwest have been going on for many years, man-made disasters happen all the time and the plague has been spreading, as a result, many are the cities that have already been deserted. These deserted cities are full of all sorts of miscreants in search of loot and goblins making trouble. The cities' former glory can only be seen in the broken walls and flagstones. \n\nDevil slayers with experience can easily make out the abnormalities, the magic with which the air is suffused, that evidences the demonic magic eating away at the city. Crazed inhabitants rampage through the streets. Groups of mountain bandits put in a lot of effort, but in the end, they couldn't bring the city under their control. Devil slayers poured in, but it wasn't to save the inhabitants, rather it was just to get the "materials" that they need.
book.book_baike_008.title=Battlefield
book.book_baike_008.desc=A battlefield in the northeast where the Imperial Court was recently driven out and the Jianzhou army suffered heavy casualties. There's really no plausible way to bury the dead due to the sheer quantity of corpses that litter the ground as far as the eye can see. It doesn't help that many have already transformed into skeleton warriors. The skeleton warriors possess a memory of their former glory in combat and have come to view the living as their enemy. They're quite difficult to deal with since they no longer possess flesh, blood and a sense of pain. \n\nFrom time to time Jianzhou soldiers patrol the area, keeping an eye out for the Ming dynasty army's counteroffensive while doing their best to clear the area of skeleton warriors. Now, it may not be possible to complete this task, as it's going to be difficult to restore the calm to this area that it knew before all of the recent events transpired. \n\nDevil slayers rarely come to the front lines. It's not that they can't find what they need there, rather it's that they would prefer not to get mixed up with the military.
book.book_baike_009.title=Woodlands
book.book_baike_009.desc=A forest in the foothills full of all kinds of otherworldly beasts. There is a natural untamed ferocity that emanates from this place. This place also marks the extent of man's domain. Feline devils that will slit your throat with ease, hoards of cunning rodent devils, venomous spiders…this place is like a filter for all of the cruelty that exists in nature. Proceed with caution, no matter what travelers face herein presents a lethal threat. \n\nOf course, that's not to say that mankind has not left its mark here, this place represents the best of hunting grounds for devil slayers—abundant demonic beasts, all manner of materials are able to be found her and it's not far from the realm of man, thus making it convenient for those needing to resupply. As a result, it's quite easy to find signs of scuffles between man and devils here.
book.book_baike_010.title=Marshlands
book.book_baike_010.desc=These marshlands, far from any place where humans reside, is full of traps at every turn. With killer vines that will reach up out of the mire seeking passersby, fruit that will burst open and release a toxic gas if you stray to close, and poisoned earth make this place a testing ground for all living creatures that would stray within its borders. Those that aren't able to bear it will meet their fate, no matter whether they be man, demon or devil. \n\nFew are the devil slayers that risk crossing into these grounds for it poses too great a risk as evidenced by the so very few that escape alive. This place is a paradise for devils and beasts, particularly for those that are at home in the water this place is like a second home, but for man this place is extremely difficult to navigate. So, it rather goes without saying that if you happen to come across a devil slayer around these parts that they're certainly not going to be a novice, quite the opposite.
book.book_baike_011.title=Ancient Temple
book.book_baike_011.desc=Despite being centuries upon centuries old, this ancient temple is still home to many grand statues. This is the site where they sealed the entrance to the underworld. The ancestors used the power of faith to power the guardians of this place. Under their vigil, the demons were not able to return back to the surface. However, the protective seal has rotted away over time and not only have many demons emerged, but the guardians and machinery left behind by the elders have begun to go rampant. \n\nThe demon vanguard has already emerged and is making its way through the temple. In the temple, there are more ancient devices than monks to guard the place. But these ancient devices must not be taken lightly as many of them are already out of control and will attack indiscriminately. Don't let the lack of finesse of their movements fool you, their bodies are solid and their destructive potential is formidable, making them lethal to any human that crosses their path.
book.book_baike_012.title=Oubliette
book.book_baike_012.desc=This dungeon is the remnant of a walled city that sunk into the earth during a war in ancient times. What remains is the results of the passage of countless years. The narrow passageways and caverns that make up the oubliette are filled to the brim with skeletons. Most of the skeletons that one comes across herein are unmistakably those of demons. The rest are those of giant subterranean creatures. It's plain to see that the demons paid a heavy price for entering this subterranean world.\n\nAt present, the oubliette is fully under the demons' control and magic is flowing through the place. The high level of activity of the demons and demonic beasts as if preparing for war evidence that the demons are making preparations for something big.\n\nWords from spies have it that there are a large number of Raksa in the oubliette. These half-bloods borne from man and demon are a race that has difficulty reaching adulthood and that there are so many gathered in one place is unusual indeed.
book.book_baike_013.title=Samsara Society
book.book_baike_013.desc=It's not known when exactly it is that this mysterious society first came into being. The members are extremely few in number, but they are all the best of the best that this world has to offer. Entrance is only allowed to those recommended by its own members and they maintain a constant vigil for top talent. \n The organization belongs to no power or nation and has maintained absolute neutrality since its inception. Its member uses all of their power to change the fate of the world for the better. For the longest time, the organization didn't even have a name. Over time, it came to be known as the "Samsara Society." 
book.book_baike_014.title=Reincarnation Trial
book.book_baike_014.desc=The Samsara Society created a mystic art know as the "Samsara Technique," which allows those taking part in its trials to be reincarnated over and over again to unlock their hidden potential, thus allowing for a massive improvement in a short time. It was specifically because this organization created this mystic art that it ended up being named the "Samsara Society."\n\nThe Samsara Technique is a mystic art that goes against nature. Even within the organization itself is it a topic of controversy. Even the creator of this mystic art is unsure as to whether it is helping them to progress toward the goal of the greater good or leading to everyone's ultimate destruction. The future of the world is enshrouded in a dense haze.
book.book_baike_015.title=Demons
book.book_baike_015.desc=In the distant past, demons set foot on this earth and made the decision that this is where they would reside. Over time, the demons came to control the earth.\n\nAfter a significant amount of time had passed, the Gods also came. After time went by, they created mankind. The challenge to the demons' sovereignty increased with time. There was a war in these ancient times, an "ancient war" in which the demons were defeated by man and their sovereignty over the land and with it were forced into the subterranean world.\n\nSurvival in this subterranean realm was extremely arduous. The demons had paid a steep price and had almost met utter annihilation. They were able to slowly make a comeback, but it took a few thousand years to do so. They never gave up on returning to the surface and set about making preparations. The next clash between man and demon is not far off.
book.book_baike_016.title=Devils
book.book_baike_016.desc=Ever since the universe came into existence there have been creatures inhabiting it, normally they are simply referred to as "beasts." In ancient times the demons settled here and imbued the beasts with their magic. Some of these beasts transformed into devils. The devils increased in number and the types were many and diverse. \n\nThe devils have much more fearsome abilities than those of the beasts, but they have maintained their innate bestial ferocity and independence. Although they are all referred to as "devils," they live scattered throughout the world without anything resembling any sort of community. \n\nEven though the devils sided with the demons during the ancient war, they weren't actually under the demons' control. After the demons fled underground, the devils scattered throughout the land. Due to the devils being too great in number and too spread out, they actually still lived quite well for the few thousand years that the land was under man's control.
book.book_baike_017.title=The Gods
book.book_baike_017.desc=During ancient times there were travelers amongst the numbers of the gods that came to this land. They decided to settle thereupon. The gods' lifespan has no end, but unfortunately, the spiritual influence throughout the land does not allow the gods to persist perpetually. Thus this predestines the gods' decrease in number as inevitable. \n\nFaced with the demons that came before them, the gods were at a disadvantageous position due to their inferior numbers. To overcome this situation, the gods chose some species of beasts from the land and conducted experiments attempting to create new gods, the end result was mankind. Man's reproductive powers were incredible and enabled them to quickly become a formidable power in the realm. \n\nDuring the ancient war, the humans launched a sneak attack upon the gods and they were all but wiped out, save for a small group of gods that hid. They still remain hidden to this very day. Due to the experiments on humans attempting to create gods, they do possess a certain amount of divine genes, as such, god and man were almost identical in appearance. The small group of gods that remained hid throughout man's society, to avoid man's discovery that they enjoyed a perpetual existence, lead their lives as wanderers.
book.book_baike_018.title=Mankind
book.book_baike_018.desc=To deal with demons, in ancient times, the gods use their own genes to conduct experiments on beasts to attempt to create gods, the end result was the creation of mankind. Human's reproductive ability was incredible, as was the growth of their intelligence, this enabled them to quickly become a powerful force in the realm. They became mankind, one of the four races. \n\nEven though mankind sided with the gods in the ancient war that went on for a hundred years, but they had already completely divorced themselves from the gods, becoming their own independent entity. Before the decisive battle, humans suddenly launched a surprise attack on the gods while they were exhausted, wiping them out. Afterward, humans defeated the demons in a decisive battle. The demons fled underground, the devils scattered across the land and man began to unite the land and have continued in this fashion for several thousand years up until the present.
book.book_baike_019.title=Halfbreed
book.book_baike_019.desc=Due to differences in genes, it's rare that interracial marriages produce offspring. But, that's not to say that it's impossible. For example, there's actually a comparatively high probability of offspring from unions between devils and humans. The offspring from interracial marriages had bloodlines derived equally from both sides, thus the offspring came to be called "halfbreed." \n As it's difficult for the blood from different races to result in offspring, so the majority of the halfbreeds have weak constitutions and tend to die young. It's difficult for them to survive to adulthood. There are exceptions. Some halfbreeds don't just survive to adulthood, but they also become quite strong.
book.book_baike_020.title=Discrimination
book.book_baike_020.desc=Halfbreeds suffer extreme discrimination at the hands of both demons and humans alike. Demons look down on halfbreeds, believing their bloodline to be adulterated and lacking of nobility. Humans are repulsed by halfbreeds. Their discrimination towards halfbreeds is rooted deep in their bones. Halfbreeds live a life full of hardships in human territory, able to only exist hidden in the shadows. For fear that their identity will be discovered. If that were to happen it is very likely that they would be captured by a mob and burned to death, or worse. By contrast, devils have never cared about this type of thing, that is the existence of halfbreeds…perhaps it's more correct to say that devils don't really care about anything.
book.book_baike_021.title=The Legend of the Raksa
book.book_baike_021.desc=In "The Record of Ancient Times" it was recorded thusly: "Humans and demons fought one another from ancient times on through the ages. From time to time, humans and demons paired and gave rise to a new species, whose body is formidable and ability is extraordinary. Males were known as "Raksa," and females as "Raksasi." They ate men, slaughtered demons, and fed on devils. As luck would have it there were fairies that foretold that the earth and heavens, in the end, would be inherited by this new race. There was much fear in the people of the world and the three kingdoms of the world did not yield and their life was full of hardship." \n\nThere are people that believe that this entry indicates that the world will be changed by these halfbreeds, the "Raksa" or the "Raksasi," for better or for worse.
book.book_baike_022.title=Curse of Seniority
book.book_baike_022.desc=[Curse]\nWhenever you enter a new level, a curse may come into effect, affecting the entire level. \n\n[Curse of Seniority]\nStamina recovery speed is decreased by 50%, affecting abilities that consume stamina such as "dodge."
book.book_baike_023.title=Gentle Breeze
book.book_baike_023.desc=[Curse]\nWhenever you enter a new level, a curse may come into effect, affecting the entire level. \n\n[Gentle Breeze]\nNo matter whether friend or foe, movement speed is increased by 15%, accelerating the flow and intensity of combat.
book.book_baike_024.title=Spatial Rift
book.book_baike_024.desc=[Curse]\nWhenever you enter a new level, a curse may come into effect, affecting the entire level. \n\n[Spatial Rift]\nWhenever you enter an area, there's a chance that you will be teleported to a random area.
book.book_baike_025.title=Curse of the Slaughter
book.book_baike_025.desc=[Curse]\nWhenever you enter a new level, a curse may come into effect, affecting the entire level. \n\n[Curse of the Slaughter]\nNo matter whether friend or foe, damage received is increased by 100%. Slaughter becomes enjoyable, but death is quick.
book.book_baike_026.title=Nightfall
book.book_baike_026.desc=[Curse]\nWhenever you enter a new level, a curse may come into effect, affecting the entire level. \n\n[Nightfall]\nNight descends and thus you can only see a small area around your person and the area just ahead. Take caution for those that lurk outside of your vision are rendered all the more lethal.
book.book_baike_027.title=Thick Fog
book.book_baike_027.desc=[Curse]\nWhenever you enter a new level, a curse may come into effect, affecting the entire level. \n\n[Thick Fog]\nOther than the area directly in front of you, the area just outside of your vision becomes obscured, enemies pop in and out of sight.
book.book_battleground_001.title=The Skeleton Warrior Tactic
book.book_battleground_001.desc=My mind is conflicted and uneasy, so I decided to take down these notes. I hope in the end someone knows the truth, but at the same time I hope these notes are never discovered. \n\nWe have been at war with Jianzhou for several months. Both sides have paid a terrible price. Corpses have piled up like mountains. A few days before, I took part in a secret plot called "The Skeleton Warrior Tactic." The conspirator behind this plot was a sorcerer who had us pile bodies up and had us cast unnameable things upon the pile. Those brothers with whom we had once fought side by side now rose up once again. I knew that they no longer had any emotions and were naught but undead beasts with an unquenchable thirst for death. \n\nThe general sent out the order to withdraw. The goal of "The Skeleton Warrior Tactic" was to leave the dead to deal with the Jianzhou army. With so many skeleton warriors, this place could do naught but become an unholy prison for man.
book.book_battleground_002.title=The Jianzhou Crisis
book.book_battleground_002.desc=Nara\n\nThis is your last chance, there are only two ways this can go. Capture the Ming throne or send your head back. Remember, we have no route by which to withdraw. The demons are pushing up from the rear. The home whence we came is all but lost. The only way to let our people live on is to press forward with all of our will.
book.book_battleground_003.title=Despair
book.book_battleground_003.desc=First one comrade dies and then another. Yesterday, I had to put the second one back down. The skeleton warriors are dreadful. We kill them yet they keep coming back without end. We're ready to slit our own throats at any time and join their ranks. \n\nI want to flee, but Nara is more fearsome than the skeleton warriors. He threw deserters that had been caught into the arena and then mounted his horse and drew his sword. He used his serrated blade to rend the flesh of the deserters and left them to bleed out until they collapsed onto the ground. Finally, he used his horse to crush them into mush. The general said that doing this would prevent them from turning into skeleton warriors. I think he was really just venting out his frustrations on them. \n\nWhat is that we're even doing here…
book.book_battleground_004.title=Headless Maniac
book.book_battleground_004.desc=What the heck is this headless maniac!? It—it just jumped on into the arena just like that and then—and then it killed General Nara. It's so strong. It wields an axe in one hand and a shield in the other. It's light on its feet and attacks in a frenzy. It just stands in the arena like it's waiting for a challenger to arise. Groups of our men have entered, but only their corpses remain. \n\nThe strategist said that this monster is known as "Hsing T'ien," the beast from ancient times that fought with the gods. How could it be…who is going to get rid of it….?\n
book.book_battleground_005.title=Dreameater Pachi
book.book_battleground_005.desc=Is the general out of his mind? He's raising a mystical Pachi. What is he thinking? Although it's not to say that there wouldn't be benefits to having one around. It is eating all of our nightmares, causing the whole army to sleep like babies. I did hear that Pachis eat humans too though. Mystical beasts are mystical beasts, how could they ever be held captive by mere mortals? I'm sure we're going to reap what we sow.
book.book_battleground_006.title=General Mu
book.book_battleground_006.desc=We're withdrawing tomorrow. We're leaving this area to the Jianzhou army. If General Mu were still around, would things have come to this? \n\nHow much has the Mu family given up for the country? Everyone knows how much General Mu's leadership has done for the army. Are those in the royal court blind?! Or rather, have they been infiltrated by Jianzhou spies and agents? \n\nUpon hearing news of General Mu's death, the hearts of too many of my comrades died with him. To put it bluntly, after I go back this time, I'm going to find a way to leave the army. I can't stay here.
book.book_battle_001.title=Defend, Parry, Break Defense
book.book_battle_001.desc=[Defend]\nAvoids damage when hit by an attack and may create the opportunity for a counterattack. \n\n[Parry]\nWhen hit by an attack, not only do you not take damage, but an automatic counterattack is triggered. \n\n[Break Defense]\nAn attack that possesses the ability to break through the enemy's defense. It cannot be defended against, nor parried. When used well, "Broken," will appear over the user's body.
book.book_battle_002.title=Off Guard
book.book_battle_002.desc=[Off Guard]\nWhen one attacks an opponent, but the opponent doesn't take damage and is left with an attack of opportunity. This move is fairly quick, but there is a risk of a counterattack.
book.book_battle_003.title=Low Blow
book.book_battle_003.desc=[Low Blow]\nAttacking a target on the ground deals double the damage. This type of attack is not particularly fearsome on its own, but it can be lethal when paired with a knockdown attack. For instance, the second swing of a sledgehammer can knock an opponent down, and if the distance is right, the third will land while they're down. This can allow for quick work to be made of opponents.
book.book_battle_004.title=Juggernaut
book.book_battle_004.desc=[Juggernaut]\nWhen one is hit while under the effects of a juggernaut they can't avoid damage, but they won't get hit. Knockback distance is also halved, allowing for attacks of opportunity against the opponent after they strike. There's no way to interrupt the attacks of an opponent under the effects of juggernaut, so make sure to watch out for their counterattacks! Some of the larger enemies and the elite ones will tend to possess juggernaut. \n\nThere are no special markings allowing for the discernment as to whether an enemy possesses juggernaut, rather the only aid on that front will have to be experienced. Some wielders of certain weapons possess juggernaut temporarily while using certain moves. For example, when wielders of sledgehammers swing their sledgehammers around, they have a juggernaut, but they don't when they aren't attacking.
book.book_battle_005.title=Elite
book.book_battle_005.desc=[Elite]\nThere is a chance of coming across an elite foe while taking part in a reincarnation trial. The way to distinguish whether an enemy is an elite or not is by the aura around their feet. Elite enemies have more HP and possess juggernaut. The different colors of the aura represent different abilities. For example, the attacks of elite opponents with a blue aura deal frost damage and render the target sluggish. When defeated, elite enemies drop additional rewards, such as scrolls.
book.book_battle_006.title=Fire Damage
book.book_battle_006.desc=[Fire Damage]\nAttacks that deal fire damage may ignite the target. The amount of burn damage that the ignited target sustains depends on how powerful fire damage the attacker deals. \n\n[Burn]\nUnits that are burning receive fire damage for 10 seconds. If a unit on fire runs into an allied unit, they will also burn that unit. Thus fire damage can be put to great effect when a lone character is confronted by many. Igniting the same target merely refreshes the timer and the damage will not stack on top of the previous damage.
book.book_battle_007.title=Poison Damage
book.book_battle_007.desc=[Poison Damage]\nAttacks by units that deal poison damage can render the target poisoned. The amount of damage that a poisoned enemy takes depends on the degree of poison damage dealt by the attacker. Poison damage won't surpass that of, say, fire damage, but it will also lower the target's attack power. \n\n[Poisoned]\nPoisoned units receive a small amount of damage for 20 seconds and suffer decreased attack power for the duration. Units that are poisoned may become less aggressive. Poisoning the same target will not stack damage and will only refresh the 20-second timer. There are herbs in the wild that can be used as an antidote. Keep an eye out for them.
book.book_battle_008.title=Frost Damage
book.book_battle_008.desc=[Frost Damage]\nAttacks that deal frost damage immediately deal an equal amount of frost damage to the target and render the target sluggish for a short spell. \n\n[Chilled]\nUnits that receive frost damage may receive the chilled status effect. The chilled effect lowers units' movement speed for 10 seconds and renders them unable to evade. This is not especially significant for units whose movements were already slow, but for units whose specialty is speed, this status effect can be fatal. This effect is not stackable and will only refresh the effect's timer.
book.book_battle_009.title=Electric Damage
book.book_battle_009.desc=[Electric Damage]\nAttacks that deal electric damage also deal an equal amount of electric damage to the target and for 10 seconds randomly deal detonation damage. Electric damage is stackable and for each attack a certain amount of electricity is stored in the target's body which when triggered will detonate. \n\n[Paralysis]\nUnits that receive electric damage may become paralyzed. Paralysis doesn't affect units' movements, but the electricity that accumulates in the units' body will detonate at random. The chance of detonation depends on the condition of the unit, the lower its HP, the easier it is to detonate.
book.book_battle_010.title=Bleed Damage
book.book_battle_010.desc=[Bleed Damage]\nAttacks that deal bleed damage leave an open wound on the targets that are hit, leaving them with the bleed status effect. The degree of the bleeding depends on the strength of the bleed damage. Multiple wounds can be inflicted and thus are stackable. If the attacker is quick enough, they can leave the target with multiple open wounds. \n\n[Bleeding]\nTargets that are bleeding receive damage for 10 seconds for any wound that they have whenever they move at all. As this effect is stackable, the damage dealt by multiple wounds when the unit moves can be terrifying. The best thing to do when bleeding is to stand still until the effect wears off. Obviously this can be tricky when one is in the middle of a battle.
book.book_battle_011.title=Hit Points
book.book_battle_011.desc=[Hit Points]\nThis determines how close a unit is to death. Once HP drops to zero, the unit will die. The higher ones HP is, the more leeway there is for making mistakes. As healing medicines are rare on the field of battle, max health is an important statistic. Some items may lower max health, so make sure to choose wisely.
book.book_battle_012.title=Spirit Armor
book.book_battle_012.desc=[Spirit Armor]\nSpirit armor is a shield of spirit that covers the entire body, protecting the player from harm and canceling the damage that would otherwise be done, including damage from burns and poison. Once the spirit armor has been exhausted the user's HP will take damage. \n\n[Spirit Armor Juggernaut]\nWhen one has spirit armor, it's similar to having juggernaut. That is to say that while the user has spirit armor, it cancels damage, effectively rendering them a juggernaut as their movements aren't interrupted and knockback is halved. Spirit armor cannot be increased other than by picking it up, and it maxes out at 100.
book.book_battle_013.title=Stamina
book.book_battle_013.desc=[Stamina]\nSome special actions require the expenditure of stamina. Actions that typically require the expenditure of stamina include: evade, run, defend, some attacks that require the player to charge up, etc. Check the weapon's details to see if it requires the use of stamina. If you have no stamina, you will not be able to use certain actions. \n\n[Stamina Recovery]\nStamina recovery is quick as long as you don't try to use actions that consume stamina at the same time. Normally, stamina should fully recover within 10 seconds. \n\nMax stamina determines the number of actions that can be performed in a row.\nStamina recovery determines how frequent actions can be taken. \nThere are many items that can influence stamina, so choose wisely.

book.book_battle_014.desc=[Magic Power]\nThose partaking in the reincarnation trials are all extraordinary individuals gifted with unusual talents. Each one possesses special skills. These skills all require the expenditure of magic. A skill may be powerful, but it will also require a lot of magic to use. Max MP determines the number of times that you can use a skill in a battle. Pay special attention to your MP when in a boss fight. \n\n[MP Recovery]\nYou automatically recover some MP every time that you enter a new area. The amount recovered depends on the individual. Ajiela, for example, possesses impressive MP recovery abilities. If one possesses strong MP recovery abilities, then one won't need to worry about running out of MP. \n\n[Magic Potion]\nYou can never have enough of it! Using this potion means that you can use more skills on the battlefield, this is crucial in boss fights.

book.book_city_002.title=The Great Transformation
book.book_city_002.desc=I am beginning to regret not parting with this unit. This truly is a cursed city. Those that are left are odder by the day. Their expressions have become empty, like the lights are on, but nobody's home. It's almost as if they have lost their emotions and humanity. From time to time the sound of a woman screaming can be heard cawing like a raven. It causes me to break out in a cold sweat and my hair to stand on end. \n… An old man just walked by the door with a kitchen knife in his hand. The knife was dripping with blood… I don't want to die, but I don't want to become one of them either…\n
book.book_city_003.title=Loss of Reason
book.book_city_003.desc=February 3rd, bandits have arrived and have started looting the place bare for provisions. Thankfully I had hidden a sack of dried dates up on a rafter. \n\nFebruary 6th, provisions have been exhausted. I sought aid from an uncle, but I found his corpse instead. It had already been there for many a day. \n\n8th. Surely I am done. \n\nToday, I awoke with a blood-soaked blade in hand. My face and body are stained red with blood. I am no longer hungry and I've found that I myself am in possession of vigor. What is wrong with me? I am terrified. \n\nThis…this is not me…
book.book_city_004.title=Mountain Bandit's Missive
book.book_city_004.desc=Our work has been hampered. Devil slayers keep showing up within the city. They have clashed with our scouts countless times. We have taken significant bodily harm. Please delay the reinforcements. Also, I hope that the contact confirms once again why it is that the Devil Slayer's Guild would send members here to meddle in other's affairs. \n\nFurthermore, the city here is short on provisions and the citizens that have remained are deranged. This is not at all what could be called a formidable stronghold. If we remain quartered here for very long, I worry that our men will become affected by whatever it is that ails them. I strongly advise reconsidering the plan to hold the city.
book.book_city_005.title=Devil Slayers Investigation Notes
book.book_city_005.desc=The twelfth day of the second month of spring, I have arrived at the city. The only citizens left in the city are the elderly and infirm that are presenting an abnormally deranged condition. The reason is yet unknown. The city is full of mountain bandits, my investigation is being hindered. \n\nThe thirteenth day of the second month of spring, I spied from just outside of the administrative offices. The county magistrate is still in office, but appears to be insane, aggressive and unreachable. I will await the arrival of support to proceed. \n\nThe fourteenth day of the second month of spring, support has yet to arrive. I suspect the source of the citizens' abnormal condition to lie herein. I have decided to investigate the administrative offices post-haste. \n\n…
book.book_city_006.title=Bloodstained Notes
book.book_city_006.desc=…\nI came across the bodies of master and the county magistrate in the administrative offices along with the corpses of countless officials. The perpetrator was nowhere to be found. There was however a terrifying yet indescribable foul stench weighing the whole area down. I will maintain my watch for two more days. \n\nTwo bands of mountain bandits descended on the administrative offices one after the other, though they never returned again. It seems that there is something unspeakably dangerous within. We have decided to scout the area over after nightfall. \n\nDamnable Insects! They are what has taken up residence in the administrative offices… We killed many but couldn't get at the Brainbug. It was all for naught. We must fall back to tend to our wounds. Fellow devil slayers that find these notes, I pray that you proceed with the utmost caution.\n\n

book.book_city_007.desc=As an official, you have one post, you must benefit one party. As an official, you must first ensure that you are a good man and that the people's best interest comes first above all. Upon this day, I must save myself. \n\nThe heavens do not pity man. It has been three years now that we have persisted in this drought and the masses go hungry and crazed with disease, could it be that my governance is the cause? \n\nToday, the masses have left seeking fairer fortunes to the south. I hope that there is even the slimmest chance of survival for them. I must attend to the administrative officials and maintain my post to the end.\n

book.book_city_008.desc=Today, was the coronation. I am now a man. My beloved mother has been away from home for 15 years. I am most preoccupied. I most commit myself to your teachings, mother. I must give thanks to heaven and earth and do my best to bring benefit to the people.
book.book_city_009.title=Steward's Notes
book.book_city_009.desc=The city has been arrested by this mad affliction for a fortnight already. Those from the palace were only afflicted once they had left, which proves my suspicions that this affliction is transmitted either by close contact or by water. The palace has maintained a strict policy of isolation from the outside, what's more it has its own wells, so it has thus far weathered the storm. \n\nI tasked several men with maintaining a close watch over the wells to investigate whether it was that the water was poisoned. We discovered that the master of the administrative offices was behaving abnormally. Could it be that the problem lies with the master? \n\nHeavens, the master has remained at the administrative offices and has not returned, could something have gone wrong? This is no good, I must pass this news along to the master.
book.book_forest_001.title=Serene Night
book.book_forest_001.desc=The moonlight was quite bright on this night. It set my mind at ease. Even the red pupils flickering in the shadows have become ever so lovely. \n\nHow many times have I been reincarnated?… I can't recall. My favorite part of this journey is the wilderness. The monsters are vicious, if one isn't careful, one will wind up dead. This place is pure, a place purely devoted to survival. There is no infighting with no other humans around, nor any conflict of values to be had. This place is purely a struggle for survival, it sets my mind at ease. \n\nThere must be one of the feline devils hiding in the forest over to the left. He must think that I am his next meal. I should go ahead and pretend to sleep.
book.book_forest_002.title=Analysis of the Possibility of an Alliance between Devils and Demons.
book.book_forest_002.desc=According to information gathered from 37 observation points, the monsters behavior has exhibited no abnormalities and have exhibited no semblances of unified behavior. They have maintained the original dispersed living patterns exhibited by their groups. \n\nAccording to my analysis of the situation, there is no evidence to prove that there is the slightest joint operation involved between the demons and devils. I suggest canceling or halting actions intended to exterminate dens of devils to avoid potential retaliations. Excessive conflict will push them against us, perhaps it would be better not to push our luck.
book.book_forest_003.title=Rat Devils
book.book_forest_003.desc=The work focused on the devils has been completed in the first area of the forest. There are several large and small groups of them. Only three of them represent a threat, the rats, the felines and the spiders. \n\nOf the three, take particular caution when dealing with the rats. There have even been investigators that claim to have discovered a Gray Immortal deep within the bamboo forest. As the leader of the rat devils, the Gray Immortal does not only excel at magic, but it has incredible leadership ability and is constantly scheming. Of the five immortals, the Gray Immortal has the most subordinates at his command. \n\nIf there is any sort of organized threat that coalesces from amongst the devils, it is most probably going to be the doing of the Gray Immortal. I strongly recommend contacting the Devil Slayer's Guild to request that they dispatch devil slayers to the bamboo forest to try to take out the immortal.

book.book_greatwall_001.title=Eastern Depot Overseer
book.book_greatwall_001.desc=On the surface, the two of them treat each other with great respect. But us old dogs can tell that Lord Paul is unhappy. We've heard that the Eastern Depot has dispatched overseers to all military camps to serve as imperial eyes. They have absolute power and report directly to the emperor himself. Could it be that officials as important as Lord Paul are being scrutinized as well?\n\nThe one sent to our garrison is a bit odd now that I think of it. Not only is he a man of great strength, but his skills in firearms are unmatched, what's more, he's nothing like the weak eunuchs at the palace. Hopefully he'll give fighting our enemies his all.
book.book_greatwall_002.title=Skeletal Immortal
book.book_greatwall_002.desc=I can't for my life understand why the remaining soldiers of the defeated Northeastern Army are joining my camp. Without General Mu they are nothing; they fear the enemy something fiercely and are far from the elite warriors they once were.\n\nThat magician is the oddest of them all. He is surrounded by an aura of death. Lord Paul has warned us to keep our distance from him and just let him be. However, he's affecting the army's morale.
book.book_greatwall_003.title=Three-Barreled Blunderbusses
book.book_greatwall_003.desc=Before departure, Lord Houhu stayed in our camp for a while and in the end, we decided on a three-barreled blunderbuss. It is a rather crude design, and possess the least accuracy and armor-piercing ability of any I have seen. Though, its merit is obvious—it is incredibly simple to use. When war begins, high-quality blunderbusses are for those stationed at the capital. But anyway, these crude ones are what we need for our operation.
book.book_greatwall_004.title=Flamebringer Camp
book.book_greatwall_004.desc=I have been here for almost a whole month, and I've grown accustomed to the cold stares and taunts. We were once the first battalion, but have been reduced to guarding storages. General Mu, we're truly sorry.\n\nWhat's so great about the Flamebringer Camp? Aren't they just running around with firearms? We at the first battalion would never lose if we had that amount of firearms. That Lord Paul is nothing compared to our General Mu. He only shows up once or twice a month. He's said to have buried himself in weaponry research, but we'll be long dead before he shows any results.
book.book_greatwall_005.title=Test Report
book.book_greatwall_005.desc=Trial blunderbuss No.5, Stormcall Blunderbuss, trial 18.\n\nTest: Body extended by one foot. A thunder charm has been carved inside the barrel. Gunpowder reduced by half. Magic infusion increased by 10%.\n\nResults: Works well. Power as expected. Range has increased. The test blunderbuss has been transferred to Lord Paul.

book.book_guimian_002.title=Missive to his highness Lord Lee.
book.book_guimian_002.desc=Lord Lee,\n\nThe actions taken by the Samsara Society cannot be allowed to continue unhindered. We take this matter very seriously. We do not fear these buffoons, but we know not whether their objective is in line with your own grand scheme? My lord's inaction leads me to question your sincerity in this matter. \n\n(The missive was signed with a drawing of some winged monster)
book.book_guimian_003.title=Directive from Lord Lee
book.book_guimian_003.desc=The Samsara Society has interfered with our plans quite enough. Proceed to the sealed ground and put a stop to them. \n\nMoney is no object! \n\nLee
book.book_guimian_004.title=Lord Lee's Rage
book.book_guimian_004.desc=Arrested Spirit,\n\nIt's up to you now. Now put blind faith in your men. Many have already failed in this task. This has already put my plan in jeopardy. Father is assigning The Veil to you so that I may concentrate on my own affairs. If you are not able to lead The Veil, return the post to me and accept punishment from father. \n\nDon't forget, you are the top assassin. Don't make a mockery of this title. \n\n-Lee\n
book.book_jiuli_001.title=About the Investigation into the Raksa
book.book_jiuli_001.desc=The sages believe that the demons may be deliberately raising Raksa to bring about the destruction of the world itself. As this may be the case, I have elected to take part in the investigations. I am now at the end of my rope and may not be able to escape alive. With any luck I will be able to escape from here and warn the people of the world. \n\nIt is recorded upon ancient books: Men and demons have fought each other from time immemorial to the present without end. From time to time man and demon paired and gave rise to a new species, whose body was formidable and its ability extraordinary. Males were known as "Raksa," and females as "Raksasi." They ate men, slaughtered demons, and fed on devils. As luck would have it there were fairies that foretold that the earth and heavens in the end would be inherited by this new race. \n\nAs far as I have witnessed, the demons raising Raksa are not few in number. Furthermore, they are extremely formidable, one alone could take on a hundred. They are crazed and adept at killing. It would be a disaster upon earth if they were allowed to reach the surface.
book.book_jiuli_002.title=Military Strength Assessment
book.book_jiuli_002.desc=Periodic report on military strength: \n\nAll preparations for the first regiment are complete. Half have already reached the surface through a fissure. Those remaining are preparing to head out according to plan. Operations have gone smoothly. \n\nThe second regiment has been fully deployed. They are gathered at the passageway and are awaiting orders. \n\nThe third regiment is at a great risk. They have lived underground for far too long. Troops that will be able to adapt to battle on the surface are too few in number. Currently, one fifth are ready and it would seem that it will not be possible to adhere to the original plan. Once the fighting starts, they will not be able to continue for long. If conditions are relaxed, it may cause instability. \n\nAsk the strategists to seriously reconsider. We will consider according to the original plan until new orders are received.
book.book_jiuli_003.title=The Darakam Clan's Dictatorship
book.book_jiuli_003.desc=The demons have changed. The clan's council exists in name only. The Darakam clan's dictatorship is brutal, it excludes outsiders and employs cruel methods. \n\nLook at the Shakar Clan, how did they even get on Shao Darakam's bad side, but all of a sudden he claimed that they were conspiring with the masses, he branded them as traitors, and brought together a few clans to exterminate them. Such an ancient and storied clan is wiped out on a whim. \n\nFriendly clans of the Shakars didn't dare speak out for they were too aggrieved.
book.book_jiuli_004.title=Spies Deployed
book.book_jiuli_004.desc=The spies have reported the following: \n\nSpying on all of the great powers on the surface has gone smoothly. They have infiltrated the majority and progress is going as expected. The contribution of the abilities of chameleon devils when it comes to infiltration has been immense. It would fully be worth it to increase research investment and training. \n\nWe have not been able to make headway infiltrating the two organizations. One of which has been the Imperial Guard's Hidden Bureau. There aren't that many people in this organization, but some of its members are able to sense the presence of devils. Several attempts at infiltrating them have been made, but they have all ended in failure. \n\nThe other organization is the Samsara Society.
book.book_npc_001.title=The Lantern Keeper's Relics
book.book_npc_001.desc=The Lantern Keeper Sundong Gong is the infamous head of the Devil Slayer's Guild and one of the twelve pillars that hold the organization up. At meetings, Sundong Gong is more of a neutral observer, preferring not to burden himself with the minutiae. He, instead prefers to spend his time roaming about the land disguised as an old tomb keeper searching for fresh talent for the guild. There are also rumors going around that he has joined the Samsara Society, though he and the society have both denied that there is any credence to said rumors. \n\nIt's possible that challengers of the reincarnation trials may come across the mysterious old man. He may appear if the challenger defeats the boss without losing any HP. The Lantern Keeper will grant the challenger a topnotch relic, but the challenger will have to pay a steep price in the form of a portion of their life in return. There are some challengers with fiery personalities that choose to attack the Lantern Keeper to try to get their hands on the relic that way. This is easier than it sounds, as one would have to be in legendary form to do so.
book.book_npc_002.title=Message from the King of Thieves
book.book_npc_002.desc=You that have this message in your hand, could it be that you are in search of the [Jadesoul Pendant]? \n\nHah! You're too naive. Did you really think that something as good as that would be left waiting for you where it was first found? Your very own "King of Thieves" has already absconded with the treasure in this very box on your behalf, you're welcome. \n\nI've gone on ahead. If you're truly this slow, the only thing I can say when you go searching for other treasure is "I'm sorry."
book.book_npc_003.title=Buried Dagger
book.book_npc_003.desc=This morning, my beloved dagger "Loyalty" finally broke. I buried it here where "Loyalty"\n and I fought, here upon this very field. I hope that this dagger has a spirit so that it may continue to protect the very ground in which it rests. \n\nYijia Zhang, I long for you yet again. If only you, the master craftsman were here, "Loyalty" could surely be reforged. If only you, the master craftsman were here, surely this battle would have not been so badly lost. \n\nWhy did you flee? Why did you become a deserter? We took an oath back then to protect this here land and yet you fled! \n\nNeither "Loyalty," nor I will forgive you.
book.book_npc_004.title=An artificer?
book.book_npc_004.desc=Truly this is amusing. Raven was "alive," was he a male or female? I originally mistook him for a man, but I almost lost it when he was able to embroider a pair of birds on satchel. \n\nPerhaps Raven is only one artificer such as this on Earth. Perhaps only the Samsara Society can transmit a soul into a vessel, is that what they call eternal life?
book.book_npc_005.title=Is she a demon?
book.book_npc_005.desc=I dare say, that old crone IS a demon. What kind of damned trial is this? It's just some sort of torture of her own design. Making me slay devils to absorb souls and then give them to her so that she can improve the trials, it's just a way to enhance the torture! \n\nI'm gonna slay her myself once I get back!
book.book_npc_006.title=Bystander
book.book_npc_006.desc=What I just love to do at the Pavilion of Spirits? Curl up with some scrolls and just read and read without a care in the world. \n\nThat old man sure is a character. It's like he doesn't even belong to this world. He just looks on at all of the happenings in this world just as neutral as can be, like some kind of bystander to it all, and then he just records it all in his scrolls. I don't think I've ever witnessed him express a real emotion, it's like he just lives for one thing, to write everything down.
book.book_npc_007.title=The Witch of Kwenlun
book.book_npc_007.desc=Who exactly is this beauty known as the "Witch of Kwenlun"? It certainly seems like she must have come from the Pavilion of Spirits or, at the very least, she's certainly spent some time there. Does that mean that she's a challenger? \n\nAfter several reincarnations, I don't think the ultimate objective of the reincarnation trials is to "take care of the key bearer" as they purport. It can't be that simple. Otherwise they surely wouldn't have chosen me to come here. If that were so, surely that Witch of Kwenlun could just take care of the whole thing. \n\nIf I were to venture a guess, that "key bearer" must surely be someone like myself who was chosen as a challenger. Maybe it might even be myself? And the trials are like a trigger that will activate that person.
book.book_temple_002.title=Artifact Restoration
book.book_temple_002.desc=It only took 36 days of work, but a total of six artifacts were restored. Three more were damaged though, and four are out of control. I don't think that this speed of corrosion can be controlled. \n\nOut of the whole family, only the two of us comprehend artifact restoration. The Zhen clan's artifact craftsmanship is not what it used to be. I fear that this may be at the heart of our current situation. \n\nThe demons were dormant for several thousand years and so the Zhen clan has long since forgotten the importance of guarding the seal. Looking at the current situation, it would seem that it's only a matter of time before the seal completely rots away. We will witness that seal fail within our lifetime and then the demon hordes will return to the surface right here. \n\nPerhaps we don't have long left, but we have to keep working, otherwise how we will face our ancestors?
book.book_temple_003.title=The Future of the Zhen Clan
book.book_temple_003.desc=I've been at this ten times now and I've nothing to show for it. The head of this clan is a waste of space. \n\nThe Zhen clan and the seal of the ancient temple are just ancient relics to this dynasty's monarch. When happy, a symbolic reward is passed down. When not, we're shooed off like flies. How many years has it been? The members of our clan are as poor as beggars. \n\nIt sounds like some sort of joke that we protect the safety of all of mankind and yet we've been forgotten. The Devil Slayer's Guild receives money for the work they do and then their praises are extolled in song. Is that fair? \n\nThe members of the Zhen clan have been powerful warriors and sorcerers since ancient times. If the demons return to the surface, we won't be the ones left crying…\n\nIf the demons return to the surface…hmph…You all who think you need the Zhen clan anymore, why then should we bother with protecting this seal?
book.book_temple_004.title=Hidden Bureau
book.book_temple_004.desc=The seal at the ancient temple can't hold up for much longer. The outlook for the Zhen clan looks bleak. Whenever the seal fails, the demons will reappear. Those that have forgotten the Zhen clan should go down in history for doing so. \n\nThe Hidden Bureau established by the imperial guard are currently recruiting top talent. That sounds like a good place to go at this juncture. My clan's abilities would come in handy. They take their salary from the court, are worshiped by the world and get to kill devils and demons as they please. \n\nFarewell clan of Zhen, farewell ancient temple's seal.
book.book_temple_005.title=The Rampaging Fallen Buddha
book.book_temple_005.desc=As the interim head of the Zhen clan, it is with a heavy heart that I record this. \n\nSeven days ago, the last of the master artificers died during the rampage of the fallen buddha. My clan has persisted to this day, but the fallen buddha going on a rampage is something that we have no way of controlling. The quantity of devils and demons spilling out from the fissure increases by the hour. The day when the ancient temple finally falls draws near. \n\nI have arranged for my cousin to lead a few clan members out of here. Hopefully, at least a trace of our bloodline will persist. As for me, as the last acting head of the clan, I intend to lead the remaining members to their end together with the seal. \n\nAncestors the Zhen clan has done its utmost.

From time to time man and demon paired and gave rise to a new species, whose body was formidable and its ability extraordinary. Males were known as "Raksa," and females as "Raksasi." They ate men, slaughtered demons, and fed on devils. As luck would have it there were fairies that foretold that the earth and heavens in the end would be inherited by this new race. There was much fear in the people of the world and the three kingdoms of the world did not yield and their life was full of hardship. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nThe sledgehammer-wielding Raksa is the most formidable demon that I have ever faced. Honestly, if it comes down to it, I would suggest fleeing when confronted by this demon.

If you can get right up next to it, killing it shouldn't present too much of a problem"
char.boss_003.role=Pachi
char.boss_003.desc="The Record of Ancient Times"\nPachi are mystical beasts from ancient times that only emerge at night to feed on dreams. Upon finding someone caught in a dream, it cracks open their skulls, sifts the brain around, extracts and eats the brain, and then stuffs it back in. Those that have had their dreams eaten find that they are full of vigor on the morrow with no damage to show for it. People waking up during the process drive the Pachi into a murderous rage that does not end well for those unfortunate enough to awake while a Pachi is feeding. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nOne needs patience to kill a Pachi. Don't be taken in by the sluggishness of its movements as it actually has very few openings, resourcefulness is required to bring one down. Before it screams, its body will expand, leaving it open for surprise attacks.

What's more frightening still is that there are devils and demons that can corrupt men's mind, driving them mad. \nByleth's Notes: \nThis one's life is already at its end, finish the job. Watch out for his magic-wielding assistant. That's what originally drove him mad. Take him out first, then achieving victory should be relatively straightforward.

The Gray Immortal is ranked the lowest amongst the five, though his followers are the most plentiful. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nFirst take care of its claws to prevent yourself from being encircled by rat devils. After the Gray Immortal transforms it goes into a rage for ten seconds, during which time it has a juggernaut effect, so watch out! After it transforms back, it creates shadow clones and shoots poison darts in a fan shape. Not even I know how to deal with it when it does this as I was injured at the time and was forced to flee.

The arboreal maiden resides deep in the forest like a beautiful nightmare. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nHunting down an arboreal maiden is an incredibly troublesome task. Her acid attack lowers the enemies attacks and deals damage over time. What is most lethal though are the thorns that suddenly shoot out from her roots and that are unblockable. If you happen to discover a bud sprouting beside her, take care of it immediately otherwise it will turn into a Rosethorn Maiden.
char.boss_008.role=Gelatinous Abomination
char.boss_008.desc="Yinyang Recipes"\nFor ghosts, the meat of an abomination is one of the eight great treasures. It is a foodstuff of the highest quality with splendid flavor that can be used in all kinds of food charms. Among abominations, the gelatinous abomination is the most respected. The gelatinous abomination is one that has lived for an extremely long time, which has enabled it to absorb the essence of the earth itself. Its flavor is unique and cannot be described in words. Gelatinous abomination are rare though and they are extremely aggressive. They also emit thick, noxious gas that can make rare food connoisseurs jobs all the more difficult. Furthermore, the spores and lesser abominations that it can spit out at would-be aggressors do not serve to make it any easier. Now, what it spits out can also be used for food, thus, as it so happens, it is said that the offal temple even raised a gelatinous abomination expressly so that they could extract foodstuffs from it. Having said that the person that raised it DID end up dying along with it…
char.boss_009.role=Forest Devil
char.boss_009.desc="Peculiar Techniques"\nThis root that took on human form over the course of hundreds of years, after thousands of years then took on the appearance of a devil of the forest…or so humans say that is how this root transformed into the devil that it now is today. Appearances can be deceiving for this particular root absolutely cannot be used for medicine like most roots can. Forest devils are a type of tree devil that sleeps hidden in the mud most of the time. Once it gets hungry it emerges and will hunt down small creatures, or even humans. Typically speaking, this devil isn't any good at combat, but if it has hunted down a lot of prey and lived for a long time then it is something to be feared as they pick up experience and techniques from its prey.
char.boss_010.role=Yellow Immortal
char.boss_010.desc="The Record of Ancient Times"\nThe Five immortals are well-renowned amongst the devils. Each has their own unique powers and the whole of the realm is within the grasp of their claws. The Yellow Immortal is a weasel devil and the master of medicine amongst the five immortals. This immortal typically stays hidden deep within the forest, researching illusion magic. Although the Yellow Immortal usually keeps to itself, it is actually one to hold very serious grudges. It will think up a million and one ways to get back at anyone that dare provoke it. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nThe Yellow Immortal is extremely difficult to kill due to how sly and cowardly it is. If it smells something fishy, it makes like a tree and splits. Perhaps the most annoying trick it has up its sleeve is a bottle of putrid farts that drive opponents crazy.
char.boss_010.a.ATTACK2_1.speech=Hi!

Each has their own unique powers and the whole of the realm is within the grasp of their claws. The White Immortal is a hedgehog devil and a well-honed swordsman. It has the strongest in wushu martial arts amongst the five immortals. If we're speaking solely on the topic of combat, none of the other 4 can even hold a candle to the White Immortal. The White Immortal is not easy to fell in battle and it is a lover of it. It frequently seeks out the best of other races to put its skills to the test. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nOnce in the distant past did I battle with the White Immortal, I'm still in pain from it. Its swordsmanship is top notch. I honestly believe that it could split the earth in twain with that great blade it wields. Grappling may be the only way to stand a chance of defeating it in combat.

char.boss_014_head.desc="Artifacts Explained"\nMankind are neither willing to step foot underground to hunt down the demons nor to allow them to return to the surface. Thus the Zhen clan placed a seal on top of the passageway with the hope that the demons would be sealed down there till the end of time. At the mouth of the passageway the Zhen clan also erected a giant buddha to ensure that the passageway would stay shut. In the thousand of years since, the demonic energy has corroded the statue, causing it to deteriorate. Unfortunately the Zhen clan has also lost their ability to maintain the artifacts during the ensuing period.

char.m051.role=Feline Devil
char.m051.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nFeline devils have the most advanced territorial awareness. They will hunt down and kill most medium and small monsters.

This particular bug reminds me of the long-legged spider, they're both nuisances. If it latches onto you won't know which way is up, right until the other bugs finish you off.
char.m057.role=The Five Oddities - Venobite
char.m057.desc="The Record of Ancient Times"\nThe five oddities are five devils in one that look like five giant bugs. Each one has a different ability. They are nocturnal and transmit disease to and misfortune on mankind. In ancient times, these creatures were raised by demons. After the demons retreated underground, the five oddities have been roaming the earth causing misfortune upon mankind. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nThere is a green bug amongst the five oddities, this is known as the "Venobite." If you can evade its bite, then you should be able to counterattack it with ease.

char.m058.role=Grass Spirit
char.m058.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nIt's fairly easy to find this green sphere floating around the forest. This little monster is my favorite out of all of them. Grass Spirits scare easily, but they wouldn't hurt a fly. When they discover that there is a wounded devil nearby, they self-destruct, giving up their life to heal the wounded.

char.m059.role=Rat Devil
char.m059.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nWhat I most despise is coming across a band of rat devils. They're crafty, nimble and they always come in great numbers. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nThe rat devil is quick on its feet and will rush at you biting and thrashing. If one is not careful they will get injured. Of particular note is their proclivity for sneak attacks from the flank. Do your best not to take on too many at once. Thankfully they do not take many hits to take down.
char.m060.role=Ratolith
char.m060.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nGoodness, never before have I seen such a strong rat. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nGiant rat devils are the warriors among the rat devils and they are extremely powerful. The wooden shield that it holds in its hand is not used for blocking, rather it's used for ramming its enemies. Once it has knocked its enemy down, it uses its tail to bash them.
char.m060_acid.role=Ratolith
char.m060_acid.desc=Elite Poison
char.m063.role=Mini Rafflesia
char.m063.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nIt is said that men cultivate plant and weed and that it has been like this for many a year. Wild grass has grown furious over this and this furor has amalgamated, coalescing into Mini Rafflesia. This saying is preposterous, I have come across Mini Rafflesia in forests where there was not a single sign of humans nearby. Steer clear of these creatures if you can. Although they can't move, they will shoot out an attack in a cross-shaped pattern at any that draw to near to them.
char.m064.role=Centipede
char.m064.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nCentipede devils frequently show up in ghost stories. Every single one of them was beheaded. The real ones are quite fearsome. There was one that came upon our encampment once. Its tail suddenly shot up out of the ground, piercing my friend in the abdomen. It took a lot of work and multiple men to bring it down. I haven't been able to rest easily on muddy ground.
char.m065.role=Mire Squad
char.m065.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nThere have been more than a few men that have been swallowed up by swamps over the years. The specters that they leave behind with their flesh and blood piles up in the swamp, transforming into a Mire Squad. They don't really have what one would call a sense of awareness, they just rather blindly chase after the living. They are also just covered in poison. Try not to get close to one, if you can manage it.
char.m066.role=Mire Battalion
char.m066.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nThere have been more than a few men that have been swallowed up by swamps over the years. The specters that they leave behind with their flesh and blood piles up in the swamp, transforming into a Mire Squad. When enough Mire Squads gather together, they form what is known as a "Mire Battalion." Not only is this...thing large, but it can also shoot out toxic gobs of mud. After you're done beating this thing to a pulp, a Mire Squad might even burst out.
char.m066.a.CAST1_1.speech=Poof!
char.m067.role=Golden Toad
char.m067.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nThe legendary "Golden Toad" that Liu Hai plays is in fact a devil. It's just that, if it does cough up money, it's not as a debt of gratitude. Golden toads are extremely intelligent, they will use people's greed to bring them harm. For example, it may leave some money lying along the path of a lone traveler, wait for it to go to pick it up and then suddenly hop out and devour them. It actually does have money in its stomach that it keeps there expressly to aid it in carrying out ruses such as these. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nThe stomach of the Golden Toad does not actually have anything of value within! Don't ask me how I know…scholars would hurt me.
char.m068.role=Croaker
char.m068.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nThe Croaker is a gigantic toad-shaped demon. It is the size of a person in stature. Upon its head there is a hard horn. Its eyes are big like balls, it's stomach is large like a drum, and it's feet are not webbed, instead claws sprout forth from its toes. This devil inhabits wets places. Its abilities in combat are fearsome and lesser skilled demons can only become its prey. It has the ability to strike its stomach to give off a…unique noise that stuns its enemies which it then rends in two.

char.m069.role=Cannon Croaker
char.m069.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nIn wet places, it's not uncommon to see cute-looking toads. Now, if its body suddenly puffs up like a great, big ball, get ready to dodge to the side as its about to shoot at you like a cannon. They suck in a lot of air that they then infuse with demonic energy and shoot back out, it is lethal if you happen to get struck by it.
char.m070.role=Kamikaze Puffer
char.m070.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nThere is a fish-like demon found in wet places that are extremely craven. If they are frightened by someone, they will frighten themselves into a stupor and subsequently charge at the target and self-destruct. It is said that they take their pain and suffering and impose it on others, so if you attack one, the more damage done to them, the more damage they will do when they self-destruct. It's a truly a tragic and frightening devil.
char.m071.role=Crag Tortoise
char.m071.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nIf you come across a Crag Tortoise in a swamp, I would suggest you stay out of its way. It's not because it's particularly skillful, rather it's that it's just a pain to have to fight. Its shell is so difficult that killing it is like trying to cut a rock. Its attacks are also fairly dull in terms of variety. Its attacks consist of trying to crush its opponent with its weight. Make sure not to let it force you into a corner.
char.m072.role=Fleshwheel
char.m072.desc="Artifacts Explained"\nWhere the Fleshwheel comes from is a mystery. It would seem that no information about its design or manufacture exists. The Zhen clan also denies having any connection with it. As such, it is currently being passed off as a product of the ancient temple's decomposition. The two halves of its outer shell are extremely tough and they roll over whatever comes in their sight without stopping. As luck would have it though, this particular artifact isn't under the demons' control, as such it attacks all that come within its path.
char.m073.role=Spiral Dragon Tower - Head
char.m073.desc="Artifacts Explained"\nThe Spiral Dragon Tower is a pseudo-artifact designed by a machinist, as a result, it isn't actually alive by any means, which means that it can only follow a set attack pattern. It is cheap to produce and maintain as a result though and is often installed in ancient temples to defend the temple from internal and external foes.
char.m074.role=Spiral Dragon Tower - Tail

char.m075.role=Jade
char.m075.desc="The Legend of the Willow Immortal"\nThe Willow Immortal is accompanied by two snakes that were created in ancient times by the exhaustion of immortal and demonic forces. The Willow Immortal found the two snakes and brought them along with it so that they could practice together. The smaller of the two is around 2 feet in length and it is glittering as of green jade, it is fluid and prideful in its movements. The larger one is of purest white as of alabaster, it is graceful and noble. The two snakes get along superbly, they neither separate nor abandon the other, and sleep intertwined together. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nThe shamrock-colored snake is nimble and flexible and wicked without compare. It likes to strike its prey from behind. Its fangs are full of venom making its bite lethal.
char.m076.role=Alabaster
char.m076.desc="The Legend of the Willow Immortal"\nThe Willow Immortal is accompanied by two snakes that were created in ancient times by the exhaustion of immortal and demonic forces.

The two snakes get along superbly, they neither separate nor abandon the other, and sleep intertwined together. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nThe bone-white snake is venomless like a python. Its power, by contrast, seems limitless. Its hide is thick, resilient and tough.
char.m077.role=Tomb Guardian
char.m077_battle.role=Tomb Guardian
char.m077_battle.desc="Artifacts Explained"\nTomb Guardians are the most common artifact found in ancient temples. They are set up as a protective device that is triggered. If you don't draw near them, they will not move one inch. After several thousands of years though the majority of them have broken down, and as the Zhen clan is low on funds, so there's is no way to replenish their numbers.
char.m077_peace.role=Inactive Tomb Guardian
char.m078.role=Shield Monk
char.m078.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nArmed monks have formed their own school amongst the devil slayers that primarily serves the Imperial Court's Hidden Bureau. The weapons used by these monks are no different than those used by your average devil slayer, though the movements of these warrior monks are more fluid and their attacks vicious. Proceed with caution when dealing with them.
char.m079.role=Wushu Monk
char.m079.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nArmed monks have formed their own school amongst the devil slayers that primarily serves the Imperial Court's Hidden Bureau. Although these monks do not make use of weapons, but their fists are lethal to be sure. Don't takes these monks lightly, they are steeped in martial arts and can take out opponents with ease no matter what weapon they may wield.
char.m080.role=Rosethorn Maiden
char.m080.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nI once happened upon a heavenly flower resting upon a rose. Her skin was like porcelain. When her eyes fell upon me, I could see the plaintive loneliness etched upon her face, I felt as if she wanted to pass it all to me; that is, until her thorn pierced my shoulder. \nByleth's Notes: \nRosethorn maidens can attack at long range and will leave a bleeding wound. The more you fear her, the more trouble she will give you. It's best to rush right up to her, that's the safest method anyways.
char.m080_shadow.role=Character used to blink by Rosethorn Maiden.
char.m081.role=Ronin
char.m081.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nSwordsmen of The Veil come from a mysterious organization of assassins that all wear some form of veil over their faces. I once engaged in several bouts with one of their leaders. His swordsmanship was rather stiff and lacking flexibility, and easy to see through as a result. Now, it must be said that his power was fearsome and could not defended against. If struck, that would surely be the end of you.

char.m083.desc="Artifacts Explained"\nThe primary defender of the ancient temple is the All-protecting God King. The sound of the All-protecting God King's playing can confuse its opponents.

char.m090.role=Messenger Devil
char.m090.desc="The Record of Ancient Times"\nDue to their fleetness of foot, Messenger Devils were once used by demons as a messenger. \n"Hongde's Notes"\nDon't try to parry a Messenger Devil's attacks. If you intend on hunting one down, you'll have to get good at catching it while it's standing still.
char.m091.role=Ancient Flame Spirit
char.m091.desc="The Record of Ancient Times"\nIn ancient wars, the ones that caused the most destruction were not gods, demons, soldiers nor generals, but rather a small devil called an "Ancient Flame Spirit." This devil is a low-level fire devil that was strengthened be the demon's magic and transformed into a frightening weapon. They can set everything nearby ablaze, and even when one manages to kill one, it explodes, leaving behind a sea of fire. This devil's numbers are many, and that its destructive power is so immense made it a nightmare on the battlefield back in that remote age.
char.m092.role=Ghost Matron
char.m092.desc="Strange Tales from the Yellow Springs"\nFolktales have it that there exists a creature that is both prolific and easy to kill known as a "Ghost Matron." It kills men and then takes their souls and turns them into apparitions. There is truth written herein, but you will also find falsehoods. The Ghost Matron is in actuality a strong devil that is highly intelligent, prolific, and that spoils its progeny. They do hunt humans and also small monster, though they do this is for food for their young. The strongest among the Ghost Matrons is called the "nine child matron" and it is formidable indeed.
char.m093.role=Apparition
char.m093.desc="Strange Tales from the Yellow Springs"\nFolktales have it that there exist apparitions and that they affix themselves to humans and suck out their life essence. This term "apparition" is commonly used to refer to the offspring of monsters. Their stature is diminutive. They typically are found crawling along the ground whence they will rush at the enemy and attack it. Apparitions transform into Ghost Matrons once they have come of age, which are all the more fearsome.
char.m097.role=Male Assassin
char.m097.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nDagger-wielding male and female demons are in fact husband and wife. They are not of little renown within demon society. It is certain that they came out onto the surface through fissure and then spread out across the realm. Although I have exchanged blows with them, I was not able to take them down. It is said that they must be beat down within a short period of time otherwise you won't be able to actually kill them.
char.m098.role=Female Assassin
char.m098.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nDagger-wielding male and female demons are in fact husband and wife. They are not of little renown within demon society.

char.m099.role=Eye Devourer
char.m099.desc="Strange Tales from the Yellow Springs"\nLegends say that there are devils that enjoy eyeballs and that will dig them out of humans' heads. You absolutely must not look at them head for you will go blind. Such a devil truly does exist and it is called an Eye Devourer. They have but one eye that can shoot out a ray that renders enemies blind for a short period of time. That is precisely when it strikes, tearing at the throat of its enemy with its claws.
char.m100.role=Headless Clansmen - Body
char.m101.role=Headless Clansmen
char.m101.desc="Strange Tales from the Yellow Springs"\nIt is said that if the head of those that were killed in a rage is hidden, the body will become a headless clansmen that wanders about heaven and earth searching for its head. There are even mages that have experimented on others, though none have proven successful. The truth is quite simple really. The tale of the headless clansmen dates back to remote ages when there was a clan known as the headless demons. If their heads were separated from their bodies the head could control the body if the distance were not too great. Its body feels no fear nor pain and there is no magic that could destroy it, it is like a divine warrior sent down from the heavens. Its weakness is its head though for if it is destroyed the body will lose all of its vitality.
char.m102.role=Spider Eggsac
char.m102.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nIf you so happen to see a green spider eggsac, do not get close for it will explode, covering you in venom! What's more spiders will crawl out.

char.m103.role=Mysterious Merchant Baldwyn
char.m103.desc=Storing your money in Baldwyn's Bank\nByleth's Notes: \nWhile out on training, no matter where you may be it's possible that Baldwyn may show his bloated face. How can a normal businessman conduct business in a place like this? I doubt his martial arts are up to snuff, what's more he's probably a member of the Samsara Society.
char.m103.a.CATCH_ATTACK1_2.speech=Are you here to shop?
char.m103.a.CATCH_ATTACK2_2.speech=Do you want money? How could it be so easy…
char.m104.role=Miserly Demon
char.m104.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nThis is the first time that I've encountered a monster even greedier than man. They gather money from all around and then hide it away in a place only they know of. I am quite curious as to what it is that they intend to do with all these coins?
char.m105.role=Lantern Keeper
char.m105.desc=Provides a relic in exchange for max HP. \n"Code of the Devil Slayer": "The tenth pillar of the assembly, the Lantern Keeper Sundong Gong" \nXilvaron's Notes: "Mr. Gong, caretaker of Heavenside Village's cemetery always does give me a vague feeling, like someone walking alongside the Yellow Springs, ignoring the cycle of life and death." Byleth's Notes: "This old man always gives me a feeling of enduringness…could it be that he's a true relic from a bygone era?"
char.m106.role=Demented Carter
char.m106.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nI can't see a hint of emotion in the eyes of the old man when he charges my way with that wooden cart of his, it's like he's a cold, empty vessel that is completely lacking a sense of awareness.
char.m107.role=Crazed Official
char.m108.role=Fake Assistant
char.m109.role=Horizontal Coffin Board
char.m110.role=Durable Coffin Board
char.m111.role=Disastoise
char.m111.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nTerms associated with turtles often include auspicious and longevity, but these cannot at all be associated with a turtle like this! This turtle is flagitious to say the least. It actively attacks travelers on the road and every year more than a few people are killed in swampy areas by it.
char.m112.role=Treasure Chest Spirit
char.m112_battle.role=Treasure Chest Spirit
char.m112_battle.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nTreasure has mesmerized people throughout history, and as a result there have been many, many treasure hunters across the ages. Of course, devil slayers are no different, and among them there are many that hope that they might chance to find some ancient treasure on their travels. Now, without even talking about all of the problems that pop up along the way, there are no assurances that treasure hunting is any safer than devil slaying, as you might die for no reason once you find yourself standing in front of a treasure chest. After all, I have borne witness to a treasure hunter being bitten by the very treasure chest that he was trying to open, leaving only the lower half of his body standing in front of the chest.
char.m113.role=Thorns
char.m114.role=Devil Bud
char.m115.role=Palpitating Abomination
char.m115.desc="Yinyang Recipes"\nA bucket of abominations is easy enough to make, the only problem being the main ingredient is hard to come by. In wet areas, it's possible to come across an abomination shaped somewhat like a bucket that will shoot tentacles out at enemies. After killing it, make sure to remove the tentacles and try to maintain the bucket-shape of the body intact to not influence the mouthfeel of the dish. The next step is to fill the body with seasonings such as ginger, garlic and chives, then to pop it onto the stove where you will boil it for a quarter of an hour, the flavor is exquisite and very fresh. As the flesh of this creature is yang in nature, it has a tendency to attract ghosts to feed on it, use yin seasoning to help dissipate the yang qi that is given off.
char.m116.role=Exploding Spore
char.m116.desc="Yinyang Recipes"\nExploding spores cannot be used for cooking. I want to bring this up here because it is easy to come across dangerous creatures such as this one when dealing with gelatinous abominations. It's entirely common to find multiple exploding spores within the body of gelatinous abominations. These spores tend to explode and it is VERY easy to have an accident.
char.m117.role=Tendril Abomination
char.m117.desc="Yinyang Recipes"\nTendril abominations is special type of abomination that looks like a ball of flesh that can suddenly launch a thorn-tipped tentacle out at prey and then suck the blood out of the corpse with it. This type of abomination does not a good meal make, though it can be cooked into a dish with a yin nature.
char.m118.role=Soulrender
char.m118.desc="Yinyang Recipes"\nThere are many fine ingredients to be found in the subterranean realm. Soulrender is one that can be found hiding in rocky areas. The texture of its flesh is exquisite and fresh without compare. It is free of any toxins and can be eaten raw, braised, or in a variety of ways. Watch out when collecting them though as they are not defenseless. An adult of this species sucks blood and can even suck the soul out of its prey. Anyone or anything that disturbs their rock is liable to be attacked.
char.m119.role=Marrow Worm
char.m119.desc="Yinyang Recipes"\nMarrow can be drawn out of the rotting bones of giant beasts, but one must watch out for skeleton worms hiding within the corpse. As its name would indicate, this creature hides within skeletons. It will attack any that dare disturb its bony home. The skeleton worm's body is itself chock full of bone fragments rendering it unfit for consumption.
char.m120.role=King of Thieves
char.m120.desc=Use a key to obtain a reward.
char.m120.a.ATTACK1_1.speech=Clever ones lead short lives.
char.m121.role=Money Doll
char.m121.desc="Strange Tales from the Road"\nMoney dolls are a creature seemingly right out of a folktale and one of the most popular of all of the devils to boot. As the saying goes if there's plenty of money to go around who wouldn't like it? This creature is a low-tier devil that is of no threat to man. They do have an impressive ability though, it's called their ability to escape, they are masterful at turning tail. This creature has the habit of collecting money and since they're not easy to hunt down, each one of them purportedly is loaded with money. That's also the reason why it is the most coveted target of any devil slayer.
char.m130.role=Flamebringer Camp - Blunderbussier
char.m130.desc="The War on the Northern Front"\nThe war was escalating. Around 2,500 soldiers were stationed at the Flamebringer Camp's northern wall, half were equipped with firearms. Mainly the three-barrel blunderbuss, they have sufficient gunpowder and are protected by rattan shields. They should have no trouble withstanding the attack.\n"Essays on Artifacts"\nThe Three-Barreled Blunderbuss is a short firearm cast from iron or crude steel. They are cheap to manufacture and requires little to no skill to handle. They are highly suitable for large armies. They have fairly short range and takes long to reload, but can be used to clobber the enemy if the need should arise.
char.m130_fire.role=Flamebringer Camp - Blunderbussier
char.m131.role=Flamebringer Camp - Rattan Shieldguard
char.m131.desc="The War on the Northern Front"\nThirty percent of the troops stationed at the Flamebringer Camp are made up of rattan shieldguards. During battle, these will be placed among the blunderbussiers so as to hinder the enemy from taking them out. Otherwise they are in charge of protecting the gunpowder storages, which is why they are forbidden to carry tinder when on duty.
char.m131_thunder.role=Flamebringer Camp - Rattan Shieldguard
char.m132.role=Flamebringer Camp - Grenadier
char.m132.desc="The War on the Northern Front"\nWhen defending the northern wall, each blunderbussier troop is accompanied by one grenadier, capable of wreaking havoc among the enemy.\n"Essays on Artifacts"\nThe grenades are inferior to blunderbusses when it comes to piercing armor, but their explosive radius is massive and are mainly used as strategic weapons. By mixing different ingredients together, a wide array of different grenades can be created.
char.m132_acid.role=Flamebringer Camp - Grenadier
char.m133.role=Flamebringer Camp - Captain
char.m133.desc="The War on the Northern Front"\nEach group is made up of five soldiers, with the most proficient one as their leader. A troop is made up of five groups, each captain proficient in both martial arts and calligraphy; one capable of teaching as well as passing orders.

dtri.dt_weapon_017.a.3.speech=A sneak attack combined with a five-hit combo should do it.

Now, not even Baldwyn is insane enough to open a store up in the underworld.
ecptips.etips_002.title=Baldwyn's Bank
ecptips.etips_002.desc=The mysterious merchant Baldwyn has also opened up a bank on the side. If you happen to come across him, you can store your money with him, it's guaranteed not to get lost. Of course, if you want to get the money back from him, that's a bit more complicated as you will have to defeat him in a battle to do so.
ecptips.etips_003.title=Challenge Rooms
ecptips.etips_003.desc=There are some from martial arts circles that will wait around in designated locations in the wilderness for formidable opponents to challenge. If you can defeat them, the reward will be worth it. Some of these challenge rooms do have terrifying things in them if you happen to come across one, that's just fate.
ecptips.etips_004.title=Hidden Rooms
ecptips.etips_004.desc=Each level has a hidden area. Normally, there is no way to see the entrance to hidden areas and they can only be opened by using a {cl}disenchantment bead{/c} in front of the phantom. As hidden areas only have one entrance and they are connected to normal areas, they are not impossible to find.
ecptips.etips_005.title=Treasure Rooms
ecptips.etips_005.desc=Keeping a key handy in case you come across a treasure room is a good option given that a key is the only way to gain entrance to the room.
ecptips.etips_006.title=Stone Chest
ecptips.etips_006.desc=Sometimes we discover a chest that we have no way of opening. The locks on these chests have rusted shut, using a key on them is useless. If you want to get it open, you'll have to blast it open.
ecptips.etips_007.title=Deserted City
ecptips.etips_007.desc=Natural disasters in the northwest have been going on for many years, man-made disasters happen all the time and the plague has been spreading, as a result, many are the cities that have already been deserted. These deserted cities are full of all sorts of miscreants in search of loot and goblins making trouble. The cities' former glory can only be seen in the broken walls and flagstones.
ecptips.etips_008.title=Battlefield
ecptips.etips_008.desc=A battlefield in the northeast where the Imperial Court was recently driven out and the Jianzhou army suffered heavy casualties. There are broken weapons all over the place here. The place is riddled with the corpses of officers and soldiers. Many of them have already turned into skeleton warriors as there's no way to bury the bodies. From time to time a patrolling soldier from the Jianzhou army will pass by, inevitably another battle will ensue.
ecptips.etips_009.title=Woodlands
ecptips.etips_009.desc=There is a bamboo forest at the foot of the mountains here that is full of monsters and devil slayers. There is a natural untamed ferocity that emanates from this place. This place also marks the extent of human's domain.
ecptips.etips_010.title=Marshlands
ecptips.etips_010.desc=This area is full of marshes with dangerous traps all around such as vines that reach up out from the mud and grab at your legs and fruit that will burst in a cloud of poison if you venture too close. This place is like heaven and earth's testing ground for life or death, if you're not up to the task, you won't make it out alive. Few are the devil slayers that brave this area, though this place is like a heaven for the devils, especially the ones that are at home in wet environments.
ecptips.etips_011.title=Ancient Temple
ecptips.etips_011.desc=Despite being centuries upon centuries old, this ancient temple is still home to many grand statues. This is the site where humans sealed the entrance to the underworld. This place was once the fabled city of Jiuli. The ancestors used the power of faith to power the guardians of this place. Under their vigil, the demons were not able to return back to the surface. Over time, the seal protecting this place is wearing away. Not only have many demons emerged, but the guardians and machinery left behind by the elders have begun to go rampant. There are many vessels here that attack any intruder in a frenzy.
ecptips.etips_011_1.title=Oubliette
ecptips.etips_011_1.desc=This is the place where the ancient city Jiuli sunk down into the earth for the ancient war. This place consists of long, narrow passageways and empty caverns.

ecptips.etips_012.title=Defend, Parry, Break Defense
ecptips.etips_012.desc=[Defend] Avoids damage when hit by an attack and may create the opportunity for a counterattack. \n[Parry] When hit by an attack, not only do you not take damage, but an automatic counterattack is triggered. \n[Break Defense] Bring defending opponents or one's that are warding off your blows down with this undefendable move. You know it's effective when you see "Broken" appear over your character. Keep your wits about you when defending against any and all opponents.
ecptips.etips_013.title=Off Guard
ecptips.etips_013.desc=When one attacks an opponent, but the opponent doesn't take damage and is left with an attack of opportunity. This move is fairly quick, but there is a risk of a counterattack.
ecptips.etips_014.title=Low Blow
ecptips.etips_014.desc=Attacking a target on the ground multiplies the damage. This type of move goes well with knockdown moves.
ecptips.etips_015.title=Juggernaut
ecptips.etips_015.desc=[Juggernaut]\nWhen one is hit while under the effects of juggernaut they can't avoid damage, but they won't get hit. Keep an eye out for attacks of opportunity against the opponent after they strike. There's no way to interrupt the attacks of an opponent under the effects of juggernaut, so make sure to watch out for their counterattacks! For example, sledgehammer- or axe-wielders, elite enemies with auras, large enemies.
ecptips.etips_016.title=Elite
ecptips.etips_016.desc=There is a chance of coming across an elite foe while taking part in a reincarnation trial. The way to distinguish whether an enemy is an elite or not is by the aura around their feet. Elite enemies have more HP and possess juggernaut. The different colors of the aura represent different abilities. After taking down an elite opponent, it will even drop items.

The members are extremely few in number, but they are all the best of the best that this world has to offer. New recruits have to be recommended by current members. Up until now, it has been joined by the best of the best to help carry out its mission. This organization through its own efforts influences the fate of the world. They strive to make the world a better place. For the longest time, the organization didn't even have a name. Over time, it came to be known as the "Samsara Society." 
ecptips.etips_019.title=Reincarnation Trial
ecptips.etips_019.desc=A few powerful members from the Samsara Society created a taboo magic "reincarnation," that enables the challengers of the trials to be reincarnated time and time again to activate their latent potential, greatly increasing their ability. It was specifically because this organization created this mystic art that it ended up being named the "Samsara Society." Reincarnation magic is a secret art that goes against the gods. There exists debate even within the organization as to whether their use of it is helping them to achieve their goal or bringing about the end of the world.
ecptips.etips_020.title=Demons
ecptips.etips_020.desc=Demons crossing through the cosmos came across this place and decided to settle down. Over time, they brought the planet under their control. It wasn't until the ancient war that the demons were defeated by mankind and forced underground.
ecptips.etips_021.title=Devils
ecptips.etips_021.desc=This land had creatures inhabiting it. When the demons took up residence here, they imbued these creatures with their demonic energy, those that absorbed the energy became devils. The devils have much more fearsome abilities than those of the beasts, but they have maintained their innate bestial ferocity and independence. Although they are all referred to as "devils," they live scattered throughout the world without anything resembling any sort of community. The devils are also not under the control of the demons. 
ecptips.etips_022.title=The Gods
ecptips.etips_022.desc=During ancient times there were travelers amongst the numbers of the gods that came to this land. They decided to settle thereupon. The gods' lifespan has no end, but unfortunately the spiritual influence throughout the land does not allow the gods to persist perpetually. Faced with the demons that came before them, the gods were at a disadvantageous position due to their inferior numbers. During the ancient war, man launched a sneak attack upon the gods and they were all but wiped out, save for a small group of gods that hid. They still remain hidden to this very day.
ecptips.etips_023.title=Mankind
ecptips.etips_023.desc=In ancient times, to deal with the demons, the gods used their divine power to influence the local creatures, which caused one race to experience rapid development. Said race is the, at present, most powerful, mankind. Man exterminated the gods during the ancient war and drove the demons underground, taking control of heaven and earth.
ecptips.etips_024.title=Halfbreed
ecptips.etips_024.desc=Due to differences in genes, it's rare that interracial marriages produce offspring. But, that's not to say that it's impossible. For example, there's actually a comparatively high probability of offspring from unions between devils and humans. The offspring from interracial marriages had bloodlines derived equally from both sides, thus the offspring came to be called "halfbreed." As it's difficult for the blood from different races to result in offspring, so the majority of the halfbreeds have weak constitutions and tend to die young. It's difficult for them to survive to adulthood. There are exceptions. Some halfbreeds don't just survive to adulthood, but they also become quite strong.
ecptips.etips_025.title=Discrimination
ecptips.etips_025.desc=Halfbreeds suffer extreme discrimination at the hands of both demons and humans alike. Demons look down on halfbreeds, believing their bloodline to be adulterated and lacking of nobility. Humans are repulsed by halfbreeds. Their discrimination towards halfbreeds is rooted deep in their bones. Halfbreeds live a life full of hardships in human territory, able to only exist hidden in the shadows. For fear that their identity will be discovered. If that were to happen it is very likely that they would be captured by a mob and burned to death, or worse. By contrast, devils have never cared about this type of thing, that is the existence of halfbreeds…perhaps it's more correct to say that devils don't really care about anything.
ecptips.etips_026.title=The Legend of the Raksa
ecptips.etips_026.desc="The Record of Ancient Times": "Man and demon have fought each other since time immemorial to the present without end. From time to time man and demon paired and gave rise to a new species, whose body was formidable and its ability extraordinary. Males were known as "Raksa," and females as "Raksasi." They ate men, slaughtered demons, and fed on devils. As luck would have it there were fairies that foretold that the earth and heavens in the end would be inherited by this new race. There was much fear in the people of the world and the three kingdoms of the world did not yield and their life was full of hardship." \nThere are people that believe that this entry indicates that the world will be changed by these halfbreeds, the "Raksa" or the "Raksasi," for better or for worse.

loot.item_p001_01.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nA long, single-edged sword longer than arm's length. The standard arm of the devil slayer, it is even and well-balanced. It is flexible at a medium distance and a great weapon for beginners. The longsword is deft and well-suited for successive offense strikes, able to keep most opponents suppressed. Furthermore, due to its length, its attack range is quite substantial, allowing it to ward off those that would surround the user.

The second-best longsword there is. \nByleth's Notes\nDivine craftsmen are adept at controlling fire, they once even forged a whole set of flaming weaponry, this is one of that set. This whole sword is aflame, so if you charge up and then wave, flames will swing out, increasing attack range. If an opponent is nearby, it will deal secondary damage.

loot.item_p001_03.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nThis refined steel longsword is extremely sharp in addition to possessing all of the advantages of your typical longsword and thus causes bleeding to opponents that are stabbed by it. Bleeding on the battlefield is extremely dangerous as moving or attacking will cause you to hemorrhage, it also doesn't help that the wounds are stackable. If you DO happen to find yourself bleeding, stand still and wait for it to heal, though this will leave you open.

loot.item_p001_05.desc="Compendium of Arms"\nThe most famous of all toxic swords is the Poison Fang created by a famous demon blacksmith back during ancient times. The entire sword is covered in poison. This sword is the third best longsword there is. This sword is excellent for stabbing, charge up energy and then stab away. It even has an aura that shoots out that will damage enemies at long range. The strong poison covering this blade causes them to lose life and lowers attack.

loot.item_p001_06.desc="Compendium of Arms"\nUnfettered, pristine, capable of toppling the heavens and splitting the earth, this blade tops the list of longswords. The Pristine Blade's origins are odd, but it is without a doubt an excellent sword. This sword swipes like the wind and even has an aura about it that extends the range of its attacks.

loot.item_p001_07.title=Iaido Blade
loot.item_p001_07.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nThe Iaido Blade is often used by ronins of the East. Their great technique allows them to wield their weapon at great speeds, with immense power and allows them to deflect blows. This blade works rather poorly for continuous attacks as the wielder must re-sheath it before striking again.

Legend has it that the first wielder of this polearm was Sheng Wu who suffocated to death and whose soul then possessed the blade of the polearm imbuing the weapon with vigor. This weapon is rather unique amongst polearms. The blade is quite wide and heavy making it exceptionally suitable for slashing.

The user needs to pay close attention to the distance between themselves and their opponents. Use jabs or stabs as necessary. Especially stabs, if you can stab the enemy and follow it up it can be lethal. The spears swing can be used when surrounded, though this attack doesn't deal the most damage.

loot.item_p002_03.title=Iron-studded Staff
loot.item_p002_03.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nThe Iron-studded Staff is similar in appearance to the spear, though different in important ways. It is slightly shorter and its swings deal more damage than its thrusts so they're used in quite different ways. Using a staff one can stun or knockdown the enemy with ease. This polearm is flexible and quick making it suitable for first strikes.

loot.item_p002_04.title=Hooked Spear
loot.item_p002_04.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nThe Hooked Spear improved on the design of the spearhead. It doesn't matter how you slice it, it's better than the normal spear in every way. Generals that didn't mind spending some extra money all choose to replace their spear with a hooked one. Early on devil slayers rarely used this type of weapon, but as more and more soldiers joined their ranks, polearms have been showing up all over.

loot.item_p002_05.title=Bamboo Spear
loot.item_p002_05.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nThe Bamboo Spear is an extreme version of the spear. It's longer, making it good for long-ranged attacks. You have to pay particularly close attention to the distance between yourself and the opponent when using a Bamboo Spear. If they get too close, it could spell disaster. It's fairly uncommon for devil slayers that travel alone to employ this type of weapon, but its uses in a regiment are great.

loot.item_p002_06.desc="Compendium of Arms"\nThe second best amongst the polearms, the Serpent Sting purportedly was forged by the demons using a giant serpent's fang. The head of this spear is poisoned, as a result, all of its attacks deal poison damage. Although its might is boundless, due to its appearance, has caused fear in more than just its opponents and so it is considered an inauspicious item.

loot.item_p002_07.title=Bloodletter
loot.item_p002_07.desc="Compendium of Arms"\nThe top-ranked polearm, the Bloodletter was produced by the Mystic Nine Crows using gold from a meteorite. The design of the spearhead is unique in its ability to pierce and cause the target to bleed. The target's wounds won't heal and thus bleed without stop. The wounds are stackable, which can be lethal, it's truly a formidable polearm.

loot.item_p003_01.desc="Hongde's Notes"\nSledgehammers are heavy and limit the agility of the wielder, but they sure do deal a lot of damage. A sledgehammer's weight makes its attacks fierce. While swinging, the wielder possesses juggernaut making their attacks unable to be interrupted, and it can't hurt that all of their attacks break defense. The strengths and weaknesses of heavy weapons are quite prominent, whether to deal with them are up to the user.

loot.item_p003_04.desc=Yijia Zhang's Notes\nA deranged general came to me to have me design this weapon. The design is extremely complex, so I had to make use of all types of theories. When the head hits the ground, it shoots blades out in four directions. Its attacks have some serious range. While using this weapon, it's all right if the enemy is further away than normal, try using the blades that it shoots out to hit the enemy. That general ended up earning quite a few merits while using this here sledgehammer. His fate is the stuff of legends. Legend has it that he was surrounded on all sides and killed more than ten famous warriors before succumbing to the onslaught. It's not known where the spiked sledgehammer disappeared to afterwards.

It is said that the smith that forged this weapon was a king of skeleton warriors. This weapon can protect the user by attacking. Every time that it kills someone, it provides a piece of bone armor.

Not only can it protect the wielder from fire, but it freezes the enemy, slowing them down and renders them unable to dodge. The fate of this weapon is a tragedy. Thanks to its ability to get dissipate heat thanks to the icy air that it gives off, so it was bought by a rich businessman who uses it to fight off the scorching heat of the sun. Of course this attracted countless hunters of rare weapons who aimed to steal it, but none of them were successful.

Using dodge can help you to get up close to the enemy, a flurry of your blades will put an end to your opponent. Be careful, as the power of the left-handed blade is not up to par, so the opponent can counterattack that hand. Pierce is a move frequently used for surprise attacks at long range, but one has to be careful as running out of stamina can put the user in a real mess.

Withering Claws actually aren't made of metal, rather its blades are made from beast fangs, fangs that contain venom. This poison causes the opponents HP to slowly slip away as it decreases their attack power. The origins of this weapon are not well understood, but most claim that it is another weapon forged in ancient times by a demon.

This combination ranks second amongst all of the swords and shields. \nByleth's Notes\nDivine craftsmen are adept at controlling fire, they once even forged a whole set of flaming weaponry, this is one of that set. The Sword & Shield excels at defense, not offense, thankfully the magma sword makes up for this shortcoming. With a weapon that can set the enemy ablaze, all you have to do is worry about defense.

As the craftsmanship of this Sword & Shield is quite complex, so it's not possible to mass produce it, but despite this it gives the wielder access to long-range capabilities. The shield can be thrown far and be used to defend up close. What's more it can also cause the opponent to bleed without stop. It's one of my proudest creations.

loot.item_p005_05.desc=Ralciel Mu's Notes\nTrading a sword for a war fork, this looks kind of like something a bandit ought to be using, but it's actually quite practical. The war fork has no way of slashing, but you can stab people with it from quite far away. In organized combat, the one that has the greater reach has the advantage. Letting the enemies sword ricochet off your shield then thrusting your war fork at them is a classic move.

talk.talk_book_battleground_001.s.3.talk=This is too many skeleton warriors, it's like a "human disaster." This ploy by the emperor is going too far.
talk.talk_book_battleground_001.s.3.o.1.talk=Is there no bottom line!? If my father were in command, this would all be over. Not that this is of any use here. They've employed sorcery, it's disrespectful to the dead and it has turned this area into a veritable hell on earth.
talk.talk_book_battleground_001.s.3.o.2.talk=Using the dead to create an opportunity for war; to be honest, that is quite creative. But I've done much crazier things in the Shadow Division.
talk.talk_book_battleground_002.s.3.talk=Is General Nara's insanity his nature or is it because he's been driven to it?
talk.talk_book_battleground_002.s.3.o.1.talk=What is the demon being referred to? Is there a way out to the rear of the Jianzhou army?
talk.talk_book_battleground_002.s.3.o.3.talk=Nara is an old rival of my father's. The soldiers are good, but they die too easily. It is said that many years ago he lost his command due to a felony…what has made them decide to put him back in power?
talk.talk_book_battleground_002.s.3.o.2.talk=The Jianzhou army has been quite aggressive these past few years, it makes one think about the possibility that they have been infiltrated by spies. Could the conflict between these two countries be that organization's doing?
talk.talk_book_battleground_003.n.1.s.3.talk=Is General Nara truly so frightening? Let me be the judge of that. If I take him out, won't that count as lending a hand to the Ming emperor?
talk.talk_book_battleground_003.n.1.s.3.o.1.talk=General Nara is in the tent up ahead. Father, are you watching me from up in heaven? Let me help you finish things with him once and for all
talk.talk_book_battleground_003.n.4.s.3.talk=Hsing T'ien? Why would the god of war be here at the Jianzhou army's encampment? This isn't gonna be a piece of cake, this god of slaughter is off the deep end.
talk.talk_book_battleground_003.n.4.s.3.o.2.talk=Hsing T'ien? It's been a long time. I didn't have any business calling you an opponent back then. Let's have a bout or two.
talk.talk_book_battleground_003.n.4.s.3.o.3.talk=What are you doing here? Who set him free?
talk.talk_book_battleground_003.n.4.s.3.o.4.talk=No matter who the opponent is, this land was protected by my father. Everyone out of my way!
talk.talk_book_battleground_003.n.4.s.3.o.1.talk=Hsing T'ien? Why did those old fogies let him run around doing as he pleases? When he goes crazy, there's no controlling him.
talk.talk_book_battleground_003.n.6.s.3.talk=Are my eyes playing tricks on me? I thought Pachis were afraid of people? How could it be raised in a pen?
talk.talk_book_battleground_006.s.3.talk=The imperial court is a political stage, they never talk about reason nor good and evil.
talk.talk_book_battleground_006.s.3.o.3.talk=Father, there are still those here that wish you had never left. Without your guidance, the Ming army can't be resisted.
talk.talk_book_battleground_006.s.3.o.1.talk=Spies? That is hard to say. Even I don't know how many spies have infiltrated mankind.
talk.talk_book_book_013.s.2.talk=I don't quite agree with this book in that firearms are artifacts.
talk.talk_book_book_013.s.2.o.1.talk=This is the works of my teacher, it's very valuable. Hmm, perhaps I can improve upon the surmises in the latter half.
talk.talk_book_city_002.s.2.talk=That this whole city has fallen into this madness is not normal in the slightest. It's like they're under the effects of a spell.
talk.talk_book_city_003.s.2.talk=From these notes, it looks like the madness didn't happen all at once, so we can eliminate spiritual magic. Such a gradual change makes it seem like it was a slow-acting poison.
talk.talk_book_city_004.s.2.talk=These bandits aren't what they seem, they're probably a unit from a group of rebels. Why does this letter mention the Devil Slayer's Guild? Could it be possible that the Devil Slayer's Guild and the rebels are working together in some way under the table? That wouldn't be in keeping with the Devil Slayer's Guild's position of neutrality.
talk.talk_book_city_005.n.1.s.4.talk=The note ends here. The writer probably isn't around anymore. Is the source of the madness the administrative offices? I'm afraid this will be a difficult fight.
talk.talk_book_city_005.n.1.s.4.o.1.talk=These people's intelligence was clearly affected by some sort of demonic curse, does that mean that the demons are involved in all of this? But why would anyone target an abandoned city like this?
talk.talk_book_city_005.n.1.s.4.o.2.talk=Is there an outstanding figure in the administrative offices? Great, I'm supposed to clean up bad guys regardless.
talk.talk_book_city_005.n.1.s.4.o.3.talk=This seems like the Devil Slayer's Guild's investigation notes, could there be something that attracted the guild here?
talk.talk_book_city_005.n.1.s.4.o.4.talk=Madness? Hmmm, I'm afraid this is the work of a demon sorcerer. This city is already dilapidated.
talk.talk_book_city_005.n.4.s.4.talk=Damnable insects? These should be known as {cl}The Five Oddities{/c}. They are said to bring disaster on mankind. These bugs are effectively five in one, that's to say if the Brainbug isn't killed, then they will be revived without end.
talk.talk_book_city_005.n.4.s.4.o.1.talk=Damnable insects? These should be known as {cl}The Five Oddities{/c}. The leader of the demons has always been so disgusting as to raise things like these. It's way too careless. Looks like I'm gonna have to go kill that Brainbug. Let's see what you all can do.
talk.talk_book_city_005.n.4.s.4.o.3.talk=Hmph, damnable insects? Aren't these just {cl}The Five Oddities{/c}? This group of idiots wouldn't have gone to kill the Brainbug, have they!? Let me smash them to pieces!
talk.talk_book_city_005.n.4.s.4.o.4.talk=Damnable insects? These should be known as {cl}The Five Oddities{/c}. Utilizing such methods to control an occupied area is quite effective, as a long as the Brainbug isn't killed, that is. There's no way that this place could be at peace.
talk.talk_book_city_007.s.4.talk=It looks like he is a Ming official. It's a pity that the madness couldn't be beaten.
talk.talk_book_city_007.s.4.o.1.talk=…Madness was not in your nature. That's good, I'm not disappointed. Back then, I let you remain amongst the living, today I'm gonna send you off to the underworld. Hopefully you'll be a better person in your next life. Farewell.
talk.talk_book_city_008.s.2.talk=Where have I seen this handwriting before? Perhaps this is the journal of someone that was here in the city before?
talk.talk_book_city_008.s.2.o.1.talk=It's been a long time…litte orphan.
talk.talk_book_city_009.s.3.talk=So this madness was caused by something put in the city's wells, that's crafty. If you stay in the city, you just have to eat food from your own stores and not drink the water.
talk.talk_book_city_009.s.3.o.1.talk=There's nothing else here…was the officials' message able to get through? Did that litte orphan know that the master was trying to get rid of the root of the problem?
talk.talk_book_city_009.s.3.o.2.talk=And here I had thought that they had researched some high-level curse, as it turns out it was just something they slipped in the water.
talk.talk_book_forest_001.s.3.talk=This looks like some notes left behind by a challenger. I wonder where he ended up?
talk.talk_book_forest_001.s.3.o.3.talk=Peace of mind? Perhaps it could attain even just a moment's peace, perpetual peace is out of the question. Unless it's found in death, that is.
talk.talk_book_forest_001.s.3.o.2.talk=Peace of mind…perhaps when I was with Hongde. Peace for me was when I had him in my heart.
talk.talk_book_forest_001.s.3.o.4.talk=I can't make out the gist of it. If you want to talk about peace of mind, that conversation will have to wait until I've avenged my father.
talk.talk_book_forest_001.s.3.o.1.talk=Does peace of mind like this have any meaning? What's the difference between this and death?
talk.talk_book_forest_001.s.3.o.5.talk=I somewhat miss the law of the jungle… I feel that I'm becoming more like a human by the day.
talk.talk_book_forest_002.s.3.talk=It looks like people were making preparations all along. During the ancient war, the demons and devils united, the result was truly terrible. What was the deal with exterminating the demons though? Surely they couldn't have pulled it off?
talk.talk_book_forest_003.s.3.talk=Even though the Gray Immortal is the weakest of the five immortals, devil slayers honestly can't take it on. If you want to take the Gray Immortal down in an efficient manner, your best bet is for an organization to surround it and take it down, that's gonna be a large-scale operation. Is there some sort of underhanded trick to this?
talk.talk_book_forest_003.s.3.o.1.talk=如果灰仙出现在这里，那说明魔族与妖族肯定存在一定的合作。五大仙中，就属灰仙最喜欢往魔族领地跑，我在下面都见过它好几次。
talk.talk_book_forest_004.s.3.talk=That's quite the list there, is it from a chef? Can these items really be consumed?
talk.talk_book_forest_004.s.3.o.1.talk=Huh? This task comes Lotus Dong. Are these ingredients for a food charm again? The one carrying this list already bit the dust in the wilderness. It's too bad that I'm already on a mission otherwise I would help get some ingredients for Lotus Dong.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.4.s.3.talk=Once the Eastern Depot had complete control over the imperial guard, their manpower had quadrupled. We can't simply treat them as abusers of power, but must tread carefully.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.4.s.3.o.2.talk=I don't particularly like the Darakam, but the demons are far superior, both when it comes to military and political control.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.4.s.3.o.4.talk=Not even the Flamebringer Camp can avoid the game for power. Actually, my father's forces all those years ago were fiercer than the ones currently under Paul's command; so I wonder how long they will last?
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.4.s.3.o.3.talk=Is that a high-ranked warrior of the Depot Guard? According to intelligence, that is the most difficult organization within the imperial Ming court to infiltrate.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.4.s.3.o.1.talk=Overseer of the Flamebringer Camp, they say your skill in firearms is unmatched. Good, show me what you can do.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.6.s.3.talk=Could this be the magician who created the skeletons at northeastern battlefields? Is he going to make a skeletal hell of the Great Wall as well?
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.6.s.3.o.2.talk=While neither can die, the gods love life, whereas skeletons desecrate it.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.6.s.3.o.3.talk=So this is the magician creating rotten skeletons at the battlefield? I'll hammer you dead!
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.6.s.3.o.1.talk=My father says that Lord Paul is a man of vision, one completely infatuated with technology and knowledge. But how could he even think of using such wicked magic in the army? Paul, what are you trying to achieve?
talk.talk_book_greatwall_001.n.6.s.3.o.4.talk=Are you trying to claim victory with the help of necromancy? Well, there's nothing wrong with that, after all, moral has no place in war.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_003.s.3.talk=The Flamebringer Camp is equipped with rather crude three-barreled blunderbusses, but the Jianzhou army shouldn't pose any difficulty.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_003.s.3.o.1.talk=I wonder how much strength could be gained if we had enough time and funds to let Lord Houhu equip an entire troop with high-end firearms.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_004.s.1.talk=An army who suffers defeat is frowned upon, but there's nothing for it. At least the Flamebringer Camp has a huge supply of firearms, that counts when the fighting begins.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_004.s.1.o.2.talk=The soldier really does underestimate the Flamebringer Camp. Sure, their weapons are superior, but their daily training regime is what's vital. It takes quite the man to use a blunderbuss to its full extent.
talk.talk_book_greatwall_005.s.1.talk=Lord Paul seems to be researching ways of imbuing blunderbusses with magic. If he is successful, then any common soldier will be able to use these incredibly powerful weapons. Just imagining it sends chills down my spine.
talk.talk_book_guimian_001.s.2.talk=Why do they have this information? They even know my full name. It looks like someone has their sights set on the Samsara Society.
talk.talk_book_guimian_002.s.4.talk=Who exactly is Lord Lee? And this winged monster's inscribed…The Veil…what do they have to do with this? It looks like they all have their sights set on the Samsara Society.
talk.talk_book_guimian_002.s.4.o.1.talk=This design…that's right….this is the emblem of the Darakam clan. Who have they been corresponding with? At the least, we can be sure of one thing, the demons know about the reincarnation trials. I'm afraid things will be more difficult from here on out.
talk.talk_book_guimian_002.s.4.o.2.talk=The emblem of the Darakam clan? It looks like they are watching our movements. This is not good at all. If they get them involved…
talk.talk_book_guimian_003.s.3.talk=This "Lee," it looks like he's not giving up. What does our actions have to do with them?
talk.talk_book_guimian_003.s.3.o.1.talk="Lee"…The Veil…surely they're not the Lee clan? They've been off the map for hundreds of years, what do they want?
talk.talk_book_guimian_004.s.3.talk=Arrested Spirit is the leader of The Veil, so who is this "Lee" figure? What's the secret behind The Veil?
talk.talk_book_guimian_004.s.3.o.1.talk=Oh? Arrested Spirit is part of the Lee clan? The Lee clan put the Assassin's Guild together and they have an expert like Arrested Spirit at the top. What are they scheming?
talk.talk_book_jiuli_001.n.1.s.1.talk=Books in stone?
talk.talk_book_jiuli_001.n.2.s.2.talk=There are Chinese characters and blood on the paper…perhaps they were left behind by a spy that had infiltrated the demons. I suspect the author of these notes is no longer around.
talk.talk_book_jiuli_001.n.2.s.3.talk=Is that thing up ahead one of the Raksa written about in books? One against a hundred, I've killed a lot along the way. Let me take care of this demon.
talk.talk_book_jiuli_001.n.2.s.3.o.3.talk=Turning a halfbreed into a crazed slaughterer. Is the demon in power insane?!
talk.talk_book_jiuli_001.n.2.s.3.o.1.talk=Raksa are halfbreeds like me…Mother said if Raksa couldn't control their own power that they would turn into mindless slaughterers. Facing one of them is like facing your own inner demons. Let me see, a crazed Raksa or a calm Raksasi, which will survive.
talk.talk_book_jiuli_001.n.2.s.3.o.2.talk=The powerful Raksa? Could they have resumed their plan to use Raksa to destroy the world that was set aside hundred of years ago? Do the elders not worry that the Raksa will destroy my entire race?
talk.talk_book_jiuli_001.n.4.s.1.talk=These look like Chinese characters, was this left behind by an infiltrator…? Unfortunately it was chewed up by bugs so I can't make out what it says…
talk.talk_book_jiuli_002.s.2.talk=The demons are obviously preparing for war. Although this seems like a difficult situation, but will the humans be able to resist them?
talk.talk_book_jiuli_002.s.2.o.2.talk=War for the demons is that truly a good thing? The Darakam clan is good at war, but is this actually a good thing for the rest of the clans? How many will be sacrificed if there's a repeat of the ancient war?
talk.talk_book_jiuli_002.s.2.o.1.talk=The demons have already started to amass troops, meanwhile the Ming emperor and Jianzhou are slaughtering each other. Father, if you were still here, what would do?
talk.talk_book_jiuli_002.s.2.o.3.talk=The demons have begun gathering an army again; I wonder if any of my clan is joining… Never mind, I have left that life behind.
talk.talk_book_jiuli_003.s.2.talk=By the looks of it there are political battles going on all over the place.
talk.talk_book_jiuli_003.s.2.o.2.talk=Shao Darakam! You bastard! I'll kill you myself.
talk.talk_book_jiuli_003.s.2.o.1.talk=The Shakar clan…? This is mother's clan. What happened?
talk.talk_book_jiuli_003.s.2.o.3.talk=Damn, the Darakam clan truly is making a move, but moving against the Shakar clan, isn't that a little much?
talk.talk_book_jiuli_004.s.2.talk=It looks like this manuscript was copied by hand, and it looks like they weren't in any sort of hurry. A war of spies…you have me and I have you.
talk.talk_book_jiuli_004.s.2.o.3.talk=It looks like this manuscript was copied by hand, and it looks like they weren't in any sort of hurry. A war of spies…you have me and I have you. Though the demons do use chameleon devils as spies making it truly difficult to defend against. That Xiang Mao was a disaster for Lotus Dong's family, was it just a chameleon devil?
talk.talk_book_npc_002.s.4.talk=This bastard! If I get my hands on you, hmph.
talk.talk_book_npc_003.s.3.talk=Friends defected, weapons broken, I can understand how the author felt.
talk.talk_book_npc_003.s.3.o.1.talk=Yijia Zhang? What's going on with the Mystic Nine Crows?
talk.talk_book_npc_004.s.3.talk=It looks like the remnants of a challenger's journal. Her suspicions of Raven are the same as mine own…
talk.talk_book_npc_004.s.3.o.1.talk=Immortality? What's so good about immortality…Raven looks like she's been through some serious ordeals. Is that type of life full of pain or happiness?
talk.talk_book_npc_004.s.3.o.2.talk=Huh? So then is Raven a man or a woman? Ask Raven yourself.
talk.talk_book_npc_005.s.3.talk=…This challenger had a nervous breakdown…the Old Crone looks like she's had a good life, this person on the other hand…
talk.talk_book_npc_006.s.3.talk=It's incredible, somehow the Scroll Keeper seems to never leave the Pavilion of Spirits and yet it would seem that he knows everything there it to know about the world.
talk.talk_book_npc_006.s.3.o.1.talk=Even amongst the gods he's above the rest…no, I can't say that, I don't even know whether he's actually a god.
talk.talk_book_npc_007.s.3.talk=I think there's something strange about this trial, perhaps there's something about it in the other challengers' notes. What exactly does the Samsara Society look for in us?
talk.talk_book_temple_002.s.3.talk=The Zhen clan already existed several thousand years ago, they were duty-bound to protect the Ancient Temple's seal, so how is it that they were able to fall to this extent? The seal has already been broken, the Zhen clan's duty has never been greater.
talk.talk_book_temple_002.s.3.o.1.talk=We actually aren't restricted to just using this passageway, there are some fissures spread across the world that we can use. Now, if the seal is completely destroyed though, then the army will be able to pass on through and the war between man and demon will be inevitable.
talk.talk_book_temple_002.s.3.o.2.talk=Then it will fall within the calculations that those old men made, man's peace has gone on for too long, they've grown careless.
talk.talk_book_temple_003.s.3.talk=If what is recorded in this scroll is to be believed…then the rotting of the Ancient Temple's seal was done deliberately by the Zhen clan. Evil deeds indeed are not without their causes.
talk.talk_book_temple_003.s.3.o.1.talk=Time is an amazing thing, it truly does heal all wounds, it also paralyzed men's nerves though. The contributions of the Zhen clan have been forgotten by man, perhaps it will take the reigniting of a great war between man and demons for them to remember all that the Zhen clan has sacrificed over the years.
talk.talk_book_temple_003.s.3.o.2.talk=The experiences of the Zhen clan and my own, how similar they are.
talk.talk_book_temple_003.s.3.o.3.talk=Hmph, that old geezer thought that putrefying magic was so great, when in actuality it was that the Zhen clan had stopped fulfilling their duty, otherwise this plan couldn't necessarily have been pulled off.
talk.talk_book_temple_004.s.3.talk=The Zhen clan abandoned their duties, who is to blame for this? If the monarchs had given them more support and if the people had cared for them more, then it wouldn't have come to this.
talk.talk_book_temple_004.s.3.o.1.talk=Perhaps it should have been the gods that took up the task of protecting the seal, people's ideas do change over the course of multiple generations after all. Now, of course, speaking honestly, it's not like the gods would have helped protect the seal after the humans wiped them out though.
talk.talk_book_temple_004.s.3.o.2.talk=The Hidden Bureau of the imperial guard detests devils and demons, they would slaughter just for the sake of slaughtering. Organizations like these are dangerous.
talk.talk_book_temple_005.n.4.s.1.talk=After passing down the duty of protecting the seal for a few thousand years they themselves destroyed it, it's kind of ironic. Is that thing up ahead the "The Rampaging Fallen Buddha"?
talk.talk_book_temple_005.n.6.s.1.talk=I can't hear the deafening sound made by that Fallen Buddha rampaging around anymore, did some badass take care of it?
talk.talk_game_clear.s.1.talk=Well done, you've passed through these trials!
talk.talk_game_clear.s.2.talk=Our goal hasn't been achieved yet though, and your mission is far from over…
talk.talk_game_clear.s.3.talk=(This has exceeded my expectations. Or perhaps, next time she can be made to come up against some real challenges…)
talk.talk_hero_001.s.1.talk=Do you want to hear my story?
talk.talk_hero_002.s.1.talk=Do you want to hear about my life experiences?
talk.talk_hero_002.s.2.talk=There many things that I have already forgotten, though I do remember coming to this here Pavilion of Spirits last time…
talk.talk_hero_003.s.1.talk=Let me see, in my previous reincarnations, what did I do then…
talk.talk_hero_004.s.1.talk=You want to talk about my reincarnations?
talk.talk_hero_005.s.1.talk=I always feel like I've come to this Pavilion of Spirits many times before…
talk.talk_hero_006.s.1.talk=…
talk.talk_hero_007.s.1.talk=Tired yet? Let me at 'em! I'm ready for action!
talk.talk_m103.n.1.s.2.c.TCID_DEFAULT.text=I was just passing by…
talk.talk_m103.n.1.s.2.c.TCID_1.text=Deposit 1 Coin
talk.talk_m103.n.1.s.2.c.TCID_2.text=Deposit 10 Coins
talk.talk_m103.n.1.s.2.c.TCID_3.text=Deposit All Coins
talk.talk_m103.n.1.s.2.c.TCID_FIGHT.text=I want to withdraw my money.
talk.talk_m103.n.2.s.1.talk=Why don't you mull that over some more, I'm doing this for your own good. Hehehe.
talk.talk_m103.n.4.s.1.talk=Let's find out if you've got the stuff!
talk.talk_m103.n.12.s.1.talk=It's not safe to carry money on your person these days. You can deposit your money with me, it's guaranteed to be safe! AND I won't charge you any fees!
talk.talk_m105.n.1.s.1.talk=Hehe, not bad, you were better than I thought. \nIf you give me some of your vitality, ({cl}{lantern.attr_cost} Max HP{/c}, to be specific) I'll give you an excellent {cl}relic{/c}, what do you say?
talk.talk_m105.n.1.s.2.c.TCID_DEFAULT.text=Let me think it over. (This old geezer sure is suspicious)
talk.talk_m105.n.1.s.2.c.TCID_CONFIRM.text=It's a deal then, I hope you feel you've gotten your money's worth.
talk.talk_m105.n.1.s.2.c.TCID_CONFIRM.o.1.talk=All right.
talk.talk_m105.n.1.s.2.c.TCID_FIGHT.text=Cut the chatter, take this!
talk.talk_m105.n.2.s.1.talk=Hmph, what's there to think over.
talk.talk_m105.n.8.s.2.talk=Hehe, I hope you don't let me down. I'll see you again!
talk.talk_m105.n.9.s.1.talk=It looks like you don't have the stuff, perhaps next time you'll be luckier.
talk.talk_m105.n.16.s.1.talk=Hehe, not bad, you were better than I thought. \nEh, you have the {cl}Corpse Lantern{/c}! \nAll right, you've got some good luck today. I'll give you a {cl}relic{/c} without needing anything in return.
talk.talk_m120.s.1.talk=If you have any keys, perhaps I'll give you something good in return.
talk.talk_meet_join.s.1.talk=Let me give you a leg up.
talk.talk_npc_001.n.1.s.1.talk=What, you want to see my records?
talk.talk_npc_001.n.1.s.2.talk=Hmmm, well I suppose it's all right, but be careful. Handle them with care.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.1.talk=That old geezer said that in every dark age there's always a <color=lime>key bearer</color>. Once that person was taken care of, everything carried on as it should. Hmm, that damn old geezer really is something, nobody would believe that nonsense.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.2.talk=Are you trying to get in my way?
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.2.o.1.talk=That old man has experienced countless years more than you, on what grounds are you going against his plan? What do you know?
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.2.o.2.talk=You're getting in my way?
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.2.o.3.talk=Is that old man really so bad?
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.2.o.4.talk=…I had no choice.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.2.o.5.talk=If it can dispel the darkness of the ages, no matter what, I'll try it.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.2.o.6.talk=You got me, I also think that old man behaved badly.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.3.talk=So…you're the heroine that's going to take care of the <color=lime>key bearer</color>? All right, all right, I won't get in your way. It's not my business anyways.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.4.talk=What is the deal with this place?
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.4.o.1.talk=What happened here? It's completely different from how I remember.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.5.talk=This once booming city has had some very…interesting things happen to it. Tyranny, drought, plague, insurrection… The lucky refugees that didn't die have all fled to the south. What's left? Deranged people, bandits, devils, oh, and devil slayers like you.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.6.talk=Where there's prey, there are devil slayers, this looks like a good hunting ground.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.6.o.1.talk=Natural disasters are horrible, man-made ones are tragic. What trouble are these people trying to stir up now.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.6.o.2.talk=Don't you mention the two of us in the same sentence. I'm still itching to kill a few devil slayers.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.1.s.7.talk=Who said it's not? In this world, devil slayers and officials are about the same. So, you're trying to find the <color=lime>key bearer</color>, it's hard to say if that person is here or not… Perhaps they are, it's none of my business though.
talk.talk_npc_002_01.n.2.s.1.talk=I've got a little trick, you pay a small price and you'll get some interesting things in exchange. What do you say?
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.1.talk=You didn't find that <color=lime>key bearer</color>? That's normal, otherwise the <color=lime>Reincarnation Trials</color> would have been over and done with a long time ago.
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.2.talk=Where am I? The air is filled with the smell of death.
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.3.talk=The Ming emperor and Jianzhou have been at battle here for months, corpses litter this battlefield as far as the eye can see. The Ming withdrew not long ago, only the Jianzhou army remains…and the skeleton warriors that have been rising up from the mounds of corpses.
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.4.talk=Did you bring me here because the target is here?
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.4.o.1.talk=I hate war.
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.4.o.2.talk=The Ming army uses the Mystic Nine Crows' weapons and still lost, how disappointing.
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.4.o.3.talk=Combat head on the battlefield is not for me.
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.4.o.4.talk=My father once led his troops and fought bravely here.
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.4.o.5.talk=This seems interesting, those under my command haven't seen that much action.
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.4.o.6.talk=Lord Houhu has said that the army has begun using firearms. I wonder if they have any new types.
talk.talk_npc_002_02.s.5.talk=There's death here, souls and cruelty abound. If you look hard enough all of the most horrifying things known to mankind can be found. Perhaps, perhaps your objective can be found here, who knows.
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.1.talk=You again. Your guidance hasn't helped me to find the <color=lime>key bearer</color> at all. If you're not going to help, then what are you here for?
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.2.talk=Who said I was here to help? Did you think I'm some sort of lamppost in your path here to show you the way? It seems like you've been reading too much fiction.
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.3.talk=Then do you at least know what's here?
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.4.talk=…I've seen…killer vines, venomous fangs, claws sharp enough to rend fresh from bone, and pairs upon pairs of slitted eyes staring at you from the tall grass.
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.5.talk=You're their prey, your flesh will become their sustenance, and your bones will be buried here and nourish the forest. This is the world of the devils, it's the territory of nature's children. Proceed ahead and you will enter no-man's land.
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.6.talk=It's funny, do those taking part in the Reincarnation Trials still need to fear death?
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.6.o.1.talk=Do you want to eat my flesh? You should be asking that to my blade.
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.6.o.2.talk=In my world, there are no no-man's lands.
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.6.o.3.talk=This sounds like fun!
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.6.o.4.talk=Thanks for reminding me to be careful.
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.6.o.5.talk=I walked over here from the path, what no-man's land is there to fear.
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.6.o.6.talk=Hahaha, this queen would like to see how strong the monsters are?
talk.talk_npc_002_03.s.6.o.7.talk=My home lies in the forest-clad hills, right next to the devils. So what is there to fear?
talk.talk_npc_002_04.s.1.talk=Hehehe, not bad, you were able to make it through the underbrush. Your highness is not half bad when it comes to battle.
talk.talk_npc_002_04.s.2.talk=Who exactly are you? Don't tell me that your popping up from time has nothing to do with the Pavilion of Spirits.
talk.talk_npc_002_04.s.3.talk=The Pavilion of Spirits…that truly is a distant memory. I was staying there for a bit once. I couldn't get along with that old man though, so I left. Never you mind, I'm quite curious about the Reincarnation Trials. I'd like to see how you all play.
talk.talk_npc_002_04.s.4.talk=I'm not here to play. Where even is this? The air here is so humid it feels like you could wring water from it.
talk.talk_npc_002_04.s.5.talk=This place here is a heaven for devils, a true no-man's land. Even devil slayers rarely dare venture through the forest to get here. There's barely any good land here, so movement is restricted. Watch your step, there are lethal traps all over.
talk.talk_npc_002_04.s.6.talk=Is the <color=lime>key bearer</color> that I'm looking for here?
talk.talk_npc_002_04.s.7.talk=Who knows? Even if it were that old man, he wouldn't be able to answer you. You take care, I don't want to come across your corpse too soon.
talk.talk_npc_002_05.s.1.talk=…
talk.talk_npc_002_05.s.2.talk=You're quite calm today.
talk.talk_npc_002_05.s.3.talk=Stop them, don't let the seal fully open, can you do that?
talk.talk_npc_002_05.s.4.talk=I am quite surprised, don't you want your own race to return to the surface?
talk.talk_npc_002_05.s.5.talk=What did you think would become of this world if the demon army breaks through the seal? I like this interesting world, so I have no interest in seeing the seal broken.
talk.talk_npc_002_05.s.6.talk=I can't make you any promises. The ancient seal's magic circle is decaying.
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.1.s.1.talk=This is our last meeting.
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.1.s.2.talk=You're not going down with me?
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.1.s.3.talk=Through here is the underworld, I have no interest in going back.
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.1.s.4.talk=Is the <color=lime>key bearer</color> that I'm looking for behind you?
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.2.s.1.talk=Is there any point to asking questions like that? What happens, keep pressing forward.
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.2.s.2.talk=Having a clear objective is the only way I can be sure that I'm doing something useful.
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.2.s.3.talk=Has it ever occurred to you that your trial is an objective in and of itself?
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.2.s.4.talk=…
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.4.s.1.talk=The Buddha statue that you're going to face is holding down the seal, it's an artifact built by mankind after the ancient war.
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.4.s.2.talk=Why do I have to fight the seal?
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.4.s.3.talk=After countless years stewing and being eaten away at by the demonic energy, its half destroyed and so it will attack any creatures that stray near, be they human or demon.
talk.talk_npc_002_06.n.4.s.4.talk=Is this statue the <color=lime>key bearer</color> that I am to take care of?
talk.talk_npc_002_07.s.1.talk=I never imagined I'd meet you here! Are you satisfied with the journey so far?
talk.talk_npc_002_07.s.2.talk=You aren't someone from the Reincarnation Trial, are you?
talk.talk_npc_002_07.s.3.talk=I aren't, yet I am, but does it really matter? The Reincarnation Trial taps into my power which has enabled me to observe your journey. I'm much like an observer that won't lend a hand under any circumstance.
talk.talk_npc_002_07.s.4.talk=Can you see where my journey will end? Or when it will end?
talk.talk_npc_002_07.s.5.talk=The Creator once said that the Reincarnation Trial is much like a seed; there is no knowing what it will grow into. Though, he was sure of one thing—when the trial ends, the world shall change.
talk.talk_npc_002_07.s.6.talk=Never mind, I knew you wouldn't give me an answer. But for what reason have I been brought here?
talk.talk_npc_002_07.s.6.o.1.talk=Never mind, I knew you wouldn't give me an answer. But for what reason have I been brought here? I'm certain you know about my father and his connection to the army.
talk.talk_npc_002_07.s.8.talk=War serves as the mirror to the world's essence. As one in the trials, you search for core of the world's problems, then you push that core to initiate change. The soldiers of the Flamebringer Camp are nothing more than obstacles, a trial if you will, on your journey.
talk.talk_npc_002_07.s.9.talk=I will continue onward, but don't you dare impose the Samsara Society's point of views on me. If one day I discover you are the ones in the wrong, I will not hesitate a moment and my weapon shall find its new targets.
talk.talk_npc_003.s.1.talk=Click, click!\nLittle girl, this pot here loves to research scrolls, to consume souls. If you give me some souls, I will make you stronger.
talk.talk_npc_005.s.1.talk=The trial that this immortal designed cannot have any flaws to it. If you were to provide some souls though, I could provide some useful functions for you to use on your journeys.
talk.talk_npc_006.s.1.talk=Cultivating one's morality, maintaining one's home, ruling the country, maintaining a harem of three thousand…AHEM, anyhow, first you must get your body in order. Just give me a few souls and we'll help you to become reborn. The talents activated here are permanently in effect, even if you start another Reincarnation Trial.
talk.talk_npc_007.s.1.talk=(Counting a few things on one hand) Hmm? Are you interested in my collection? These were all left by your predecessors. If you give me some souls, I'll shut my eyes and pull one on out for you. Whatever you get is up to luck mind you.
talk.talk_npc_008.s.1.talk=Congratulations! You've finally come back. \nWe must say, you've done a bang-up job in this trial! *meow*
talk.talk_npc_008.s.2.talk=We were watching all along, it looks like you're getting closer to the objective. \nUnfortunately you still weren't able to achieve your mission though. *meow*
talk.talk_npc_008.s.3.talk=Or perhaps, in the next trial you might make some new discoveries?
talk.talk_npc_008.s.5.talk=Slow down—next reincarnation? Wait, what? I didn't die; is this all the content?
talk.talk_npc_008.s.6.talk=Maybe the Crone wasn't clear enough. This is where the trial ends. There might be more in the future! *meow*
talk.talk_npc_008.s.7.talk=Hey wait…what?! What are you doing?! Stop it!
talk.talk_npc_009.n.1.s.1.talk=What, do you want to see some other weapons? If you give me 5 {cl}dark gold{/c},  I can replace them with some new ones.\nOr you can give me {blacksmith.upgrade_cost} {cl}dark gold{/c} to upgrade your current weapon.
talk.talk_npc_009.n.2.s.1.c.TCID_DEFAULT.text=Let me think it over.
talk.talk_npc_009.n.2.s.1.c.TCID_CONFIRM.text=(Pay 5 dark gold to refresh the weapon stock)
talk.talk_npc_009.n.2.s.1.c.TCID_1.text=(Pay {blacksmith.upgrade_cost} dark gold and upgrade your weapon)
talk.talk_npc_009.n.6.s.1.talk=Hmph, what a waste of my time.
talk.talk_npc_009.n.10.s.1.talk=You don't have enough {cl}dark gold{/c}. Wait until you've gathered enough and come back to see me again.
talk.talk_npc_009.n.11.s.1.talk=Hmm, I see, the purity seems good enough. Have a look at some other weapons then. \n{cl}Dark gold{/c} is actually quite useful. If you find anymore, feel free to come right on back.
talk.talk_npc_009.n.16.s.1.talk=What, you want to see some other weapons? \nIf you give me 5 {cl}dark gold{/c}, I can switch the weapons up.
talk.talk_npc_009.n.19.s.1.talk=You don't have enough {cl}dark gold{/c}. Wait until you've gathered enough and come back to see me again.
talk.talk_npc_009.n.20.s.1.talk=Well, wait a moment…
talk.talk_npc_009.n.20.s.2.talk=…
talk.talk_npc_009.n.20.s.3.talk=Done, take it.
talk.talk_npc_009.n.25.s.1.talk=You can give me {blacksmith.upgrade_cost} {cl}dark gold{/c} to upgrade your current weapon.
talk.talk_npc_011.s.1.talk=Come closer and tell me what you wish to experience. I will draw it, then burn it together with incense. This will bring you into a dreamlike state where it will appear together with you.
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.1.talk=Show the token.
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.2.talk=What is the deal with this? I haven't heard that the Devil Slayer's Guild is trying to set up any sort of regime here in the city.
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.3.talk=There's something strange going on with the residents of this city, so we were asked by Master Baruma to come and suppress the situation here. The sword has no eyes and those that aren't involved should leave.
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.4.talk=This city isn't some possession of the Devil Slayer's Guild, each have their own path to travel, why are you so arrogant.
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.4.o.1.talk=I'm not in the habit of taking orders.
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.4.o.2.talk=Are all devil slayers this arrogant? If you've got talent, why not come try to take me down?
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.4.o.3.talk=You have too much control!
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.4.o.4.talk=(If this is that monk's doing…I'll mess things up for you)
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.4.o.5.talk=What are you so proud for? You all are just a bunch of bounty hunters.
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.4.o.6.talk=Hmph, I'll stay wherever I want to.
talk.talk_npc_m001.s.5.talk=This is the last warning, I don't like to talk that much.
talk.talk_story_start.s.1.talk=My head hurts...
talk.talk_story_start.s.3.talk=You're awake. *meow* \nMmmhm, you are indeed worthy of being called the Chosen One. Your performance was even better this time. Perhaps you will be able to complete your mission once all is said and done. *meow*
talk.talk_story_start.s.2.talk=Where am I? My head is killing me, how exactly did I get here? \nI remember…I remember…Wait, I can't remember anything at all…
talk.talk_story_start.s.4.talk=There's no rush. Every time you are reincarnated, your memory will experience some erosion, this is quite normal. *meow* \nTake it easy, your memory will come back soon, as will the mission that you have yet to complete…*meow*
talk.talk_you_died.s.1.talk=This was not in keeping with my expectations. Something must've gone wrong somehow…*meow*
talk.talk_you_died.s.2.talk=But perhaps, you can do even better next time. *meow*
talk.talk_you_died.s.3.talk=Give it your best, we've got faith in you *meow* (adjusts glasses)

ulk.ulk_soul_001.desc={cl}Byleth's Notes{/c}\nMy brother used to use a Zanbatou, they're about half an arm longer than normal swords, which makes them suitable for slashing across large areas. Keep in mind the length of this sword's blade, you can keep enemies further away with it if used wisely. If you get surrounded, charge up to perform a whirlwind slash to take a slice at all enemies nearby. Now, as the sword is so long, it cannot be used to parry or any similar type of counter.
ulk.ulk_soul_002.title=Bamboo Spear
ulk.ulk_soul_002.desc={cl}"Hongde's Notes"{/c}\nThe Bamboo Spear is an extreme version of the spear. It's longer, making it good for long-ranged attacks. You have to pay particularly close attention to the distance between yourself and the opponent when using a Bamboo Spear. If they get too close, it could spell disaster. It's fairly uncommon for devil slayers that travel alone to employ this type of weapon, but its uses in a regiment are great.
ulk.ulk_soul_003.title=Swift Death
ulk.ulk_soul_003.desc={cl}Yijia Zhang's Notes{/c}\nA deranged general came to me to have me design this weapon. The design is extremely complex, so I had to make use of all types of theories. When the head hits the ground, it shoots blades out in four directions. Its attacks have some serious range. While using this weapon, it's all right if the enemy is further away than normal, try using the blades that it shoots out to hit the enemy. That general ended up earning quite a few merits while using this here sledgehammer. His fate is the stuff of legends. Legend has it that he was surrounded on all sides and killed more than ten famous warriors before succumbing to the onslaught. It's not known where the spiked sledgehammer disappeared to afterwards.

Although I found it to be it was quite a waste, I did produce a piece of armor that decreases the damage done to the wearer, unfortunately due to the weight, the wearer's movement speed is decreased as well. I never saw that piece of armor again. Perhaps some important figure is wearing it around. \n\n{cl}Effect{/c}\nDecreases damage received by 10 points and movement speed by 15%.
ulk.ulk_soul_011.title=Voodoo Doll
ulk.ulk_soul_011.desc={cl}"Strange Tales from the Yellow Springs"{/c}\nThe voodoo doll is a commonly used item in folk witchcraft. Only those with the power of an immortal can create a true voodoo doll that can save your life. Once the wielder dies, the voodoo doll automatically breaks and leaves the user revived in the previous room.

ulk.ulk_soul_018.desc={cl}"Compendium of Arms"{/c}\nDivine soldier's flaming blade. The whole sword is aflame, fear no cold, it will even set opponents aflame. The second-best longsword there is. \n\n{cl}Byleth's Notes{/c}\nDivine craftsmen are adept at controlling fire, they once even forged a whole set of flaming weaponry, this is one of that set. This whole sword is aflame, so if you charge up and then wave, flames will swing out, increasing attack range. If an opponent is nearby, it will deal secondary damage. The sword itself is rather fragile, it can't be used to parry.
ulk.ulk_soul_019.title=Pristine Blade
ulk.ulk_soul_019.desc={cl}"Compendium of Arms"{/c}\nUnfettered, pristine, capable of toppling the heavens and splitting the earth, this blade tops the list of longswords.

ulk.ulk_soul_020.title=Crescent Blade
ulk.ulk_soul_020.desc={cl}"Compendium of Arms"{/c}\nThe Crescent Blade ranks third among the polearms. Legend has it that the first wielder of this polearm was Sheng Wu who suffocated to death and whose soul then possessed the blade of the polearm imbuing the weapon with vigor. This weapon is rather unique amongst polearms. The blade is quite wide and heavy making it exceptionally suitable for slashing.

ulk.ulk_soul_021.desc={cl}"Compendium of Arms"{/c}\nThe top-ranked polearm, the Bloodletter was produced by the Mystic Nine Crows using gold from a meteorite.

It is said that the smith that forged this weapon was a king of skeleton warriors. This weapon can protect the user by attacking. Every time that it kills someone, it provides a piece of bone armor. Each piece can block one hit. As the movements of sledgehammer users are not nimble, so it is very difficult to avoid taking damage. This sledgehammer resolves that issue by providing bone armor to the user.
ulk.ulk_soul_024.title=Cryoshatterer
ulk.ulk_soul_024.desc={cl}"Compendium of Arms"{/c}\nThe Cryoshatterer is the best of the sledgehammers. 10,000-year-old ice crystals and frost iron were used in its forging. Not only can it protect the wielder from fire, but it freezes the enemy, slowing them down and renders them unable to dodge. The fate of this weapon is a tragedy. Thanks to its ability to get dissipate heat thanks to the icy air that it gives off, so it was bought by a rich businessman who uses it to fight off the scorching heat of the sun. Of course this attracted countless hunters of rare weapons who aimed to steal it, but none of them were successful.
ulk.ulk_soul_025.title=Khopesh
ulk.ulk_soul_025.desc={cl}Xilvaron's Notes{/c}\nThe Khopesh is one of the most favored of weapons amongst the Assassin's Guild. This weapon has two unique features: Elusive and bleeding. Charge up is exchanged for Elusive, enabling you to sneak right on up beside the target and use a 5-Combo Slash. Wounds made by this weapon cannot be healed and the wounds are stackable. The opponent will be left with bleeding that won't stop making it so that all you will have to do is step back and watch the opponent take itself down.
ulk.ulk_soul_027.title=Withering Claws
ulk.ulk_soul_027.desc={cl}"Compendium of Arms"{/c}\nThese rank second best amongst the dual blades.

The origins of this weapon are not well understood, but most claim that it is another weapon forged in ancient times by a demon. This legendary weapon has been fabled among the Assassin's Guild for over a millennium now. It has even become their signature weapon.
ulk.ulk_soul_028.title=Abyssal Blades
ulk.ulk_soul_028.desc={cl}"Compendium of Arms"{/c}\nThe Abyssal Blades are the best of the dual blades. These were once the central component of a sealed magic circle. This material that looks like stone and metal was stolen out of it and found its way to a master smith who forged it into these two blades. Although it has no blades, but it can stun enemies with its blows, which is quite fantastical. These blades treat their enemies just as one would expect from their outer appearance, their attacks seem like they're going to send the opponent straight to the underworld.

ulk.ulk_soul_029.desc={cl}Yijia Zhang's Notes{/c}\nI designed a Sword & Shield back then whose shield had eight blades hidden inside it, as well as chains and cuffs. As the craftsmanship of this Sword & Shield is quite complex, so it's not possible to mass produce it, but despite this it gives the wielder access to long-range capabilities. The shield can be thrown far and be used to defend up close. What's more it can also cause the opponent to bleed without stop. It's one of my proudest creations.

ulk.ulk_soul_031.desc={cl}"Compendium of Arms"{/c}\nThe top-ranked Sword & Shield, the Lapis Mace and Assault Shield have always held a treasured place in the eyes of the imperial court. The bestowing of these weapons upon a minister is a great honor. When a wielder dies with it in their hands, they return to the imperial court. Until some wielder died on the field of battle, this legendary weapon had been thought to be nothing more than a folktale. The mace is quite heavy, as a result it is able to stun opponents.
